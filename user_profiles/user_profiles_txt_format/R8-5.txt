ABSTRACT 
How  are  knowledge  workers  integrating  web-based  tools  into 
their  work?  Where  do  they  spend  their  time  while  online  at 
work?    Reporting  the  results  of  an  annual  national  survey  of 
knowledge  workers,  this  poster  offers  insight  into  the  current 
state of distributed knowledge work.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
In  a  nationwide  survey  of  knowledge  workers,  we  are  asking 
participants about their use of the web, email, IM and publicly-
available  online  services  (PAOSs)  for  their  work.  PAOSs  are 
web tools and applications that are hosted on the internet such as 
Google Docs or Basecamp. Through this annual survey, we are 
developing  a  picture  of  the  work  getting  done  when  workers 
interact with each other on the internet.  

2.  RESEARCH QUESTIONS 
Data collected from each annual offering of the survey provides 
an  understanding  of  how  the  internet  is  aiding  computer-
supported  collaborative  work  as  well  as  how  internet  use  for 
work is changing.

 This study begins by examining general information about how 
knowledge  workers  use  the  internet.    For  example,  how 
frequently  on  average  knowledge  workers  have  their  web 
browsers and IM applications open on a typical workday.  And 
how  many  web  searches  knowledge  workers  perform  during  a 
typical workday.   
 
This  study  also  examines  the  way  knowledge  workers  use 
PAOSs  by  asking  participants  how  frequently  they  perform 
specific  types  of  tasks  using  PAOSs;  for  example:  forming, 
setting  up,  or  maintaining  a  collaborative  environment  and 
managing  or  coordinating  work  on  a  collaborative  project.    In 
addition,  this  study  investigates  the  effect  of  work  location 
(home  office,  company  office)  and  company  size  (self-
employed, 2-10 people, 11-100 people, etc.) on the type of work 
done using PAOSs.  
 
Finally,  this  study  examines  the  specific  PAOSs  used  by 
knowledge  workers.    Survey  participants  are  asked  to  list  the 
PAOSs  that  are  important  to  their  work.    Comparing  and 
analyzing the list of PAOSs reported from year to year allows us 
to examine how the services workers use change.  For example, 
are  some  services  reported  more  frequently  this  year  than  last 
year?  What  is  different  about  the  services  being  reported  this 
year? Are uses of such services evolving over time? 

3.  METHODS 
The  survey  is  offered  each  year  to  a  similar  population  of 
knowledge workers in technical fields.  Each year an invitation 
to  the  survey  is  emailed  to  technology-focused  groups  such  as 
those  on  meetup.com,  which 
facilitates  meetings  and 
in  a

geographical  region. 
to 
professional groups in different regions of the country.   
 
Participant  data  is  reviewed  to  validate  the  participants  meet 
basic 
requirements.  For  example,  valid  participants  are 
employed and use the web for work.  Then, ANOVAs are run to

statistically  comparable.    For  example,  to  ensure  the  groups  of 
participants  that  respond  in  the  same  year  are  comparable  we 
require  that  there  are  no  significant  differences  in  the  mean 
number of years they have used the WWW for work as well as 
the mean percent of time they use PAOSs for work in a typical 
workday.  

4.  RESULTS 
Preliminary results from the current offering of the survey will 
be reported on the poster to be displayed at SIGDOC 2009. The 

 

results  of  this  survey  will  help  other  researchers  as  well  as 
PAOS developers understand how knowledge workers are (and 
are  not)  using  online  services,  the  effects  of  job  location  and 
company  size  on  the  use  of  PAOSs,  and  what  services  are 
becoming  more  popular.  Findings  will  be  of  interest  to  those 
who  study 
in  distributed 
workplaces.
