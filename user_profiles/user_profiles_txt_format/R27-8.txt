Abstract. Web information retrieval is best known for its use of the Web’s link
structure as a source of evidence. Global link evidence is by nature query-inde-
pendent, and is therefore no direct indicator of the topical relevance of a document
for a given search request. As a result, link information is usually considered to be
useful to identify the ‘importance’ of documents. Local link evidence, in contrast,
is query-dependent and could in principle be related to the topical relevance. We
analyse the link evidence in Wikipedia using a large set of ad hoc retrieval topics
and relevance judgements to investigate the relation between link evidence and
topical relevance.

Introduction

Web information retrieval is best known for its use of the Web’s link structure as a
source of evidence. PageRank [11] is a query-independent algorithm that measures
document importance on a global level and is not concerned with a topical relation
to the query at hand. The alternative is to analyse the link structure of local sets of
documents—e.g., the initial text-based results—to identify topically authoritative pages
for broad topics [1, 7]. What is the value of links in topic relevance tasks? This question
was addressed by constructing an IR test collection during the 1999 Small Web Task at
TREC [13], where participants tried to answer the question “whether hyperlink infor-
mation could be used to improve ad hoc retrieval effectiveness” [4]. The results from
the experiments failed to demonstrate the value of link information for ad hoc retrieval.
Arguably, the notion of what is relevant for typical Web searches is different from
the traditional IR interpretation of a document containing text relevant to a precisely
deﬁned information need. New Web-oriented tasks were designed to better reﬂect Web
search behaviour. In these Web tasks, the goal was to identify entry pages to particular
sites (in the case of home page ﬁnding and topic distillation) or another important doc-
ument (in the case of named page ﬁnding). These tasks also dictated a different notion
of relevance [12]. The experiments showed that, although links were not effective for
singling out the documents with topically relevant textual content, they are useful for
locating the documents that are important for these Web-oriented tasks. This leads to
our main research question:

– To what extent is link evidence related to the importance of documents, and to the

topical relevance of documents?

Here, global and local link evidence seem to play different roles. Links are also directed,
and link evidence is typically used for the documents they point to, i.e., inlinks. Think-
ing of incoming links as some sort of vote, inlinks are attractive to measure document
importance. However, insofar as a link is evidence that the two documents it connects
are topically related, the direction of the link seems not to matter. Topical relatedness
works both ways.

In this light, Wikipedia is an interesting data source to investigate the value of links.
It is one of the most popular web sites and, being an encyclopedia, it contains entries
on single topics, that are densely linked to related content. It is also a natural source for
informational search, where it makes sense to study topical relevance aspects of links.
Moreover, an extensive IR test collection based on Wikipedia is available thanks to the
INEX Ad hoc Tracks of 2006 to 2007. Clearly, the Wikipedia differs considerably from
the Web at large, and even the links in Wikipedia are different. We make no particular
claims on the representativeness of the Wikipedia for the general Web. Still, the same
link-related phenomena (global and local, incoming and outgoing links) are present,
and looking at the Wikipedia allows us to study them in great detail. The INEX Ad hoc
test collection allows us to study the impact of query-dependent and query-independent
link evidence with respect to the topical relevance of retrieval results. In fact, because
the INEX test collections are constructed to study the effectiveness of focused retrieval,
we have exact information on where and how much relevant text is in each article.

We will ﬁrst analyse the effectiveness of link evidence for ranking retrieval results,

addressing the questions:

– What are the characteristics of Wikipedia link structure?
– How do global and local link evidence impact retrieval effectiveness?
– How do incoming, outgoing and undirected links impact retrieval effectiveness?

Then, we look at how related the different types of link evidence are:

– How do incoming, outgoing and undirected link evidence correlate?
– How is link evidence related to the amount of relevant text in articles?

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we discuss related work.
After discussing the experimental data in Section 3, we compare the different types of
link evidence in a retrieval setting in Section 4. Then, in Section 5 we analyse the rela-
tion between the different degrees structures and the amount of relevant text in articles.
We draw conclusions in Section 6.

2 Related Work

In the TREC Web Tracks of 1999 to 2004, participants were unable to show the effec-
tiveness of link evidence for general ad hoc retrieval [3]. However, it was argued that
traditional ad hoc retrieval is very different from how people search on the Web. To
study the value of link information, tasks closer to real Web search are required [4].
With tasks adjusted to Web search scenarios, link information proved highly beneﬁ-
cial [8, 10]. This difference in effectiveness of link evidence for these tasks indicates
that link evidence does not reﬂect topical relevance.

Najork et al. [9] compared HITS authorities and hubs with several link-based rank-
ing algorithms – PageRank, Indegree and Outdegree – and found that the choice of
algorithm makes little difference on the effectiveness of link evidence. What does have
a big impact is the direction in which the evidence is used. Although adding evidence
based on outgoing links to a content-based retrieval baseline does lead to improvements,
it is much less effective than evidence based on incoming links.

Kamps and Koolen [5] showed that in Wikipedia, indegree is related to topical rele-
vance and found that incoming link evidence can be effective for ad hoc retrieval. Later,
they found that, unlike in the Web, incoming and outgoing link evidence is equally
effective for document retrieval on Wikipedia [6].

3 Wikipedia Link Structure

For the analysis, we use the INEX Wikipedia collection [2], containing 659,304 docu-
ments, and a set of 221 topics with relevance judgements from the INEX 2006–2007
Ad hoc Tracks. The union of the in- and outdegree is the undirected degree, or the total
number of pages that a page is connected to. The intersection of in- and outdegree is the
set of bidirectional links, where pages A and B link to each other. The graph contains
12.4M undirected links and 1.2M bidirectional links (9.5%). We also look at local link
evidence—considering only links between the top 100 ranked pages for a given query.
Degree statistics are shown in Table 1. Looking at the global link structure, the
maximum indegree is much higher than the maximum outdegree. The maximum and
spread of the undirected degree are very similar to those of the indegree, but the median
is more similar to that of the outdegree. The bidirectional degree is much lower because
only a small proportion (9.5%) of the links are bidirectional. When we look at the
local degrees, we see a similar pattern. The indegrees have a bigger spread than the
outdegrees, with the undirected degrees having a maximum and spread close to those
of the indegrees and a median closer but above that of the outdegrees.

The number of local links is of course smaller than in the whole link graph, but the
link density is higher. Globally, a document is connected to 0.0057% of the collection
on average, whereas in the local set, it is connected to 5.14%. We also look at the
proportion of bidirectional links by looking at the fraction of intersection within union.
This proportion is much higher in the local set (23.4%) than in the global set (9.5%).
This can be explained, at least in part, by the higher link density in the local set. The
nature of Wikipedia links may also play a role: the Wikipedia guidelines on linking [14]
state that a link to another document should only be made when it is relevant to the
context. Thus, in a set of documents related to the same query, many documents will be
related to each other and therefore cross-linked.

4 Link Evidence

In this section, we investigate the impact of link evidence on the effectiveness of ad hoc
retrieval. After that, we use standard IR effectiveness measures to evaluate a baseline
run using a language modelling framework and runs derived from the baseline but re-
ranked 1) using only link evidence and 2) using a combination of content and link
evidence.

4.1 Using Only Link Evidence

We show the results in Table 2 and will ﬁrst discuss the impact of using only link ev-
idence (and not content) for ranking. When re-ranking on global link evidence only,
indegree leads to higher early precision than outdegree, which is consistent with the hy-
pothesis that global link structure signals ‘important’ pages. With the union of the de-
grees, precision is lower than with indegree alone, but higher than with outdegrees. The
intersection of the degrees leads to a higher early precision than the indegree. The inter-
section creates a symmetric link graph that is still query-independent and seems more
effective than indegree alone. Compared to the content-only run, though, the global link
degrees are nowhere near as effective.

Although still well below the content-only run, local link degrees give much higher
scores than global degrees, indicating that by biasing the link evidence by considering
only links between documents related to the query, link information becomes more
‘semantic’. The indegrees lead to higher early precision than the outdegrees but, overall,
the outdegrees lead to a better ranking. The undirected or union degrees give even higher
scores, showing that both individual degrees contribute complementary evidence on the
relevance of documents. The scores of the intersection of the degrees are somewhat
lower than those of the other degrees, which is probably due to the fact that the number
of bidirectional links in the local set is relatively low.

4.2 Combining Link and Content Evidence

We now look at re-ranking using the combination of content and link evidence, which
we do by multiplying the retrieval score by a link degree score:

PDegree(d) ∝ 1 + Degree(d)

(1)

The bottom left part of Table 2 shows the combination of the baseline with the global
link evidence. It is clear that the global link evidence universally hurts the baseline
performance. The impact of the outdegree is smaller than that of the indegree, which
makes sense given the bigger spread of the indegrees (see Table 1). The impact of the
union of the degrees is closer to that of the outdegree, whereas the small number of
bidirectional links in the local set keep the negative impact of the global link evidence
small. Both in isolation and in combination with content evidence, global link degrees
fall short of the performance of the content-only baseline.

Using local evidence (bottom-right part of Table 2), both indegree and outdegree
can signiﬁcantly improve the baseline run. Although the indegree gives bigger improve-
ments in early precision and the outdegree gives bigger improvements further down the
ranking, at P@30, their overall improvements are very similar. Links in Wikipedia can
be used effectively in both directions as evidence to re-rank retrieval results. We then
expect that ignoring the direction of links and counting the number of connections to
other documents in the local set will lead to even better performance. The scores indeed
show further, albeit small, improvements. Precision at rank 5 is higher than for the out-
degrees, and later and overall precisions are higher than with both in- and outdegrees.
When we use only the smaller set of bidirectional links, the results are still surprisingly
good. With less than a quarter of the total links, the intersection of the degrees gives the
same performance boost as the in- and outdegrees individually.

To summarise, global link evidence may be an indicator of document importance,
but fails to help locate topically relevant documents to a speciﬁc information need.
Local link evidence fares much better. In isolation, it gives much better performance
than global link evidence, although it cannot compete with content-based evidence.
In combination with this content-only baseline, it does lead to improvements. In fact,
this combination is effective, whether we use only incoming links, outgoing links or
their union or intersection. This result supports our intuition that for topical relatedness,
the direction of links is of no importance. But in- and outdegrees affect the ranking
differently. In what way do incoming and outgoing link evidence differ from each other?
We address this question in the next section.

5 Relation between Degrees

In this section we analyse the extent to which degrees are correlated to each other. The
main difference found so far is between global and local link evidence. The differences
between incoming, outgoing, undirected and bidirectional link degrees are relatively
small. A simple explanation would be that all these degrees are strongly correlated. In-
coming and outgoing link evidence are necessarily related in some way: a link between
two documents is incoming link evidence for one document and not the other, and vice
versa for outgoing link evidence.

5.1 Correlation of Degrees

We computed rank correlations (Kendall’s Tau) between the four degree types over the
entire collection, and within the local set of retrieved results for all 221 topics (Ta-
ble 3). Over the entire collection, the in- and outdegree are moderately correlated, and

the undirected degree is very strongly correlated with outdegree and less strongly with
the indegree. This means that, on a global level, the outdegree is the dominant factor
in the undirected degree. The same holds for the bidirectional degree. The intersection
correlates most strongly with the indegree. Over the local top 100 link graphs, using the
average of the correlations of the 221 topics, the correlation between in- and outdegree
is stronger, and thereby, their correlation with the union is more similar. An explana-
tion might be the higher percentage of bidirectional links in the local sets. The overall
correlations give a broad idea of the relationship between degrees. Given that most doc-
uments have a low in- and outdegree, the correlation is dominated by these low degrees
while we are mostly interested in the other end with the highest degrees.

In Table 3 we also show the correlations between degrees over the top 10 results.
That is, we take the top 10 results ranked by the column (say, indegree) and compare
their ordering with how they are ranked by the row (say, outdegree). Note that over the
top 10, the correlation is not symmetrical: the top 10 documents by indegree can be
different from the top 10 documents by outdegree. Over the top 10, the rank correlation
between indegree and outdegree is lower than over the top 100. The top 10 ranking by
indegree corresponds better to their ranking by outdegree than the top 10 ranking by
outdegree corresponds to their ranking by indegree. The average overlap between the
two sets of top 10 documents is 4.7, thus each has 5.3 documents in the top 10 that are
not in the top 10 of the other. Over the top 100, the outdegree correlates stronger with
the undirected degree than the indegree, but over the top 10, it is the other way around.
This is reﬂected in the precision scores in Table 2. The undirected degree has an early
precision very similar to that of the indegree, while further down the results list, its
precision is closer to that of the outdegree. The correlations with the intersection are
much lower over the top than over the top 100, probably because of the lower degrees.

5.2 Correlation of Degree and Relevant Text Size

In Section 3, we saw that all four types of local link evidence show some relation to
topical relevance, as evidenced by their positive effect on performance when combined
with the content score. But not all documents are equally relevant. Some documents
might be mostly off-topic and only mention the topic in a few sentences, while others
might be fully on-topic and cover the topic exhaustively. For the INEX Ad hoc Track,
assessors are asked to highlight in yellow all and only relevant text within each pooled
document. This allows us to study the relation between link evidence and the amount of
relevant text. We assume that documents that have more relevant text discuss the topic
more exhaustively and are therefore more important to the topic.

Figure 1 shows the average amount of relevant text over the ﬁrst 10 retrieved rele-
vant documents when ranked by degree. The left-hand-side shows the content-only and

Fig. 1. The average amount of relevant text at ranks 1 to 10 for the retrieved relevant
documents ranked by content or link degree

link-only evidence. The right-hand-side shows the content and undirected link evidence
and their combination. We see that the amount of relevant text decreases over rank for
all types of evidence. The content-only evidence has the lowest amount of relevant text
at rank 1, and the outdegree the highest. In the set of retrieved relevant documents,
link evidence seems to be a good indicator of the amount of relevant text in a docu-
ment. This makes sense if local link evidence is related to topical relevance. More links
means more evidence of topical relevance, and thus more relevant to the topic. In the
right-hand ﬁgure, it is clear that the undirected degree ranking has more relevant text
at most ranks, especially at the ﬁrst 3 ranks. Thus, although the content-only score is
a better indicator of the relevance of a document—it has much higher precision and
MAP scores in Table 2—the undirected link evidence seems a better indicator of the
amount of relevant text in documents. The combination of both types of evidence has
a large impact on the amount of relevant text found at all ﬁrst 10 ranks. This indicates
that the relevant articles are ranked more favourably, an important aspect that remains
unnoticed by the standard evaluation measures.

6 Discussion and Conclusions

In this paper we investigated the relation between link evidence and topical relevance
in Wikipedia. Our main aim was to ﬁnd out to what extent link evidence is related to
document importance and to topical relevance.

The local link structure is more dense than the global link structure and has a larger
proportion of bidirectional links, making link evidence more symmetrical. Evidence
based on incoming links gives better early precision, while outgoing link evidence gives
better precision further down the ranking. Taking the union of these two degrees leads to
further improvements, showing that in- and outdegrees contribute different information.
At the local level, the different degrees all derived from the same link graph exhibit rea-
sonably high correlations, indicating that they promote many of the same documents.
However, this correlation is lower in the top of the in- and outdegree rankings. Given the
substantial difference between documents in the top 10, in- and outdegree seem to pro-
mote different documents. The degrees can also help the internal ranking of the relevant
documents by inducing a more favourable ranking in terms of the amount of relevant

One could think of notions of relevance for Web retrieval extending the
traditional topical relevance, for example, by requiring pages to be both ‘relevant’ in the
traditional sense, as well as ‘important’ or ‘authoritative’. Such a view would impose an
additional criterion on the topically relevant pages, which is supported by our analysis
of the amount of relevant text in documents.

This paper is only a ﬁrst step in understanding the value of link information. Wi-
kipedia is different from the Web at large, including its links: the Web is much more
heterogeneous and noisy, and the creation of Web links is not steered by clear guide-
lines, nor done for a single purpose. Nevertheless, the distinction between global and
local evidence holds for the Web as well. But our analysis of links in Wikipedia has
shown that the link structure contains valuable cues about topical relevance.
