Abstract 

This paper provides a game theoretic model of a crowdsourcing contest. Special attention is given 
to  the  asymptotic  behavior  of  the  contest  outcome.  We  show  that  all  significant  outcomes  of 
crowdsourcing contests will be determined by contestants in a small neighborhood (core) of the 
most  efficient  contestant  type;  in  particular,  the  asymptotic  structure  of  the  crowdsourcing 
contests is distribution-free. Our formal analysis yields a managerially implementable and easily 
understood  rule  of  thumb  for  the  optimal  division  of  the  contest  budget  among  multiple  prizes. 
When agents are risk-neutral, the principal should optimally allocate all of its budget to the top 
prize even if it values multiple submissions. In contrast, if agents are sufficiently risk-averse, the 
principal may optimally offer more prizes than the number of submissions  it desires. Our paper 
represents  the  first  general  analysis  of  the  economics  of  crowdsourcing  contests,  provides  a 
simple  rule  of  thumb  for  determining  the  optimal  prize  structure  for  practitioners  who  are 
considering  designing  such  contests,  and  also  discusses  the  welfare  implications  of  organizing 
production or R&D as a Web-based contest of this kind.

Introduction 

Markets have been around for more than people can remember, yet the structure of market interactions is not “cast 
in  stone” and  markets evolve as other social  institutions.   Technological progress brought  significant reduction  in 
search (Bakos 1997) and coordination (Malone, Yates and Benjamin 1987) costs by placing information system as 
the foundation of the electronic market. Associated increase in diversity of the goods offered  (Anderson 2004) was 
shown  to  have  major  impact  on  consumer  welfare:  Brynjolfsson,  Hu  and  Smith  (2003)  analysis  of  on-line 
bookstores demonstrates that the increased book variety alone enhanced consumer welfare by 731 million USD to 
1.03 billion  USD  in  the  year  2000,  which  is  between  7  and  10  times  as  large  as  the  consumer  welfare  gain  from 
increased  competition  and  lower  prices  in  this  market.  Increase  in  diversity  came  with  a  price  of  higher 
informational  asymmetries  than  in  the  traditional  markets:  old  economic  concepts  of  moral  hazard  (Holmstrom 
1979),  adverse  selection  (Akerlof  1970)  and  reputation  (Kreps  and  Wilson  1982)  became  particularly  salient  in 
electronic markets. 

Effects  of  electronic  markets  on  consumer  welfare  and  market  efficiency  are  well  studied  in  empirical  and 
theoretical literature  (Brown and Goolsbee 2002, Brynjolfsson and Smith 2000, Clemons, Hann and Hitt 2002),  but 
electronic  markets  are  still  evolving,  periodically  giving  birth  to  new  amazing  market  mechanisms  like  Amazon's 
product review  system and Google's sponsored search engine (Edelman, Ostrovsky and  Schwarz 2007). A recent, 
prominent and quite controversial example of such new mechanism is “crowdsourcing”. The term “crowdsourcing” 
was first used by Jeff Howe in a Wired magazine article (Howe 2006): 

Simply  defined,  crowdsourcing  represents  the  act  of  a  company  or  institution  taking  a  function  once 
performed  by  employees  and  outsourcing  it  to  an  undefined  (and  generally  large)  network  of  people 
in  the  form  of  an  open  call.  This  can  take  the  form  of  peer-production  (when  the  job  is  performed 
collaboratively),  but  is  also  often  undertaken  by  sole  individuals.  The  crucial  prerequisite  is  the  use 
of the open call format and the large network of potential laborers. 

An  important  distinguishing  feature  of  crowdsourcing,  in  addition  to  open  call  format  and  large  network  of 
contributors,    is  that  it  blurs  boundaries  between  consumption  and  production  creating  a  new  consumer  type:  the 
“working consumer” (Howe  2006). The proactive nature of  “working consumers” and their direct involvement  in 
the  production  and  innovation  processes  give  new  meaning  to  the  “long  tail”  effect  (Anderson  2004):  while  the 
original definition of the “long tail” referred to diversity of consumer tastes causing changes to the demand function 
and consequential adjustments on the supply side, crowdsourcing brings diversity of consumer experiences, skills, 
backgrounds  and  tastes  straight  to  the  supply  side  by  allowing  crowds  to  participate  directly  in  the  production 
processes. As it happened before with electronic markets, reduction in matching costs and increase in diversity (now 
on the production side) comes at a cost of potentially  higher informational asymmetries in the  market. The  major 
goal of this paper is in understanding interplay between diversity of expertise and informational asymmetries in the 
crowdsourcing setting and studying its implications for the optimal design of the crowdsourcing mechanisms. 

This  traditional  definition  of  crowdsourcing  covers  a  broad  range  of  activities  that  were  originally  performed  in-
house but now, due to reduction in production, search and coordination costs, can be outsourced to a crowd. Thus, 
crowdsourcing  can  involve  experts,  amateurs  or  any  mix  of  those,  the  participation  incentives  can  be  monetary, 
intrinsic or mixed and it can be used to produce goods, services, ideas or obtain information. In this paper, we focus 
on  a  single,  most  popular  form  of  crowdsourcing:  a  crowdsourcing  contest.  For  a  long  time,  organizations  used 
contests to procure goods and services for which spot markets do not exist, contracts are incomplete and outcomes 
are not verifiable in the court. Although in the past most procurement contests were a privilege of the government 
and large corporations, the Web now allows almost any  firm or individual to organize its own  minor competition 
with just a few mouse clicks. Typical prizes vary from a million dollars for improving the performance of a movie 
recommender system1 (Bennett and Lanning 2007) and thousands of dollars for minor pharmaceutical innovations2 
(Lakhani and Panetta 2007) to a few hundred dollars for designing a software component.3 Most of these contests do 
not have an entry fee or restrict participation in any way except for legal restrictions where applicable. In fact, many

Archak & Sundararajan  / Optimal Design of Crowdsourcing Contests 
 

contests intentionally target large crowds, as emphasized by the term “crowdsourcing contest”. Very little is known 
about welfare properties of such contests or about their optimal design.  

Although crowdsourcing contests attracted significant attention in popular press, there are only  few empirical and 
theoretical  studies  of  economic  incentives  and  strategic  behavior  of  individuals  in  crowdsourcing  contests.  Yang, 
Adamic and Ackerman (2008) examine behavior of users of the web-knowledge sharing market Taskn.com. They 
find significant variation in the expertise and productivity of the participating users: a very small core of successful 
users contributes nearly 20% of the winning solutions on the site. They also provide evidence of strategic behavior 
of  the  core  participants,  in  particular,  picking  tasks  with  lesser  expected  level  of  competition.  Motivated  by  this 
study,  DiPalantino  and  Vojnovic  (2009)  provide  a  game-theoretic  model  of  multiple  simultaneous  crowdsourcing 
contests in which agents select among, and subsequently compete in, a collection of crowdsourcing contests offering 
various  rewards.  They  model  crowdsourcing  contests  as  all-pay  auctions  with  incomplete  information  about 
contestant  skills,  the  approach  we  also  adopt  in  this  paper.  This  paper  complements  results  of  DiPalantino  and 
Vojnovic (2009): while they  focus on strategic trade-off that risk-neutral contestants face when choosing between 
multiple simultaneous single-prize contests, we investigate strategic behavior of risk-averse contestants in a single 
contest with multiple prizes. We provide existence and uniqueness result  for symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibria of 
the  crowdsourcing  contest  with  multiple  prizes,  investigate  the  asymptotic  properties  of  this  equilibrium  as  the 
number  of  contestants  grows  and  characterize  the  asymptotically  profit-maximizing  contest  design.  Our  results 
indicate that the optimal allocation of the prize budget among contest winners can vary quite widely depending on 
the risk aversion of contestants, however it is essentially distribution-free. In particular, while the principal facing 
risk-neutral agents should place all her budget on a single  prize, the same principal facing sufficiently risk-averse 
contestant pool will optimally offer more prizes than the number of submissions she values, although  the optimal 
prize amounts will exhibit exponentially decreasing marginal utility pattern. 

The  “procurement  by  contest”  mechanism  studied  in  this  paper  is  largely  new  to  the  IS  literature,  and,  although 
related,  distinguished  both  contextually  and  analytically  from  those  of  basic  auctions  for  Web-based  markets 
(Kambil  and  van  Heck  2004,  van  Heck  and  Ribbers  1997)  and  myriad  reverse  auctions  that  deal  with  e-sourcing 
(Zhong and Wu 2006) and underlie the procurement of products ranging from oil leases (Saidi and Marsden 1992) 
and timber harvest contracts (Athey and Levin 2001) to FCC spectrum (Cramton and Schwartz 2000) and sponsored 
search  slots  (Edelman,  Ostrovsky  and  Schwarz  2007).  These  reverse  auctions  require  signing  a  contract  with  the 
winning bidder and therefore may not be viable when contracts are incomplete and outcomes are not verifiable in a 
court.  In  the  latter  situations,  a  contest  might  be  a  more  feasible  option  (Taylor  1995).  The  major  difference  of  a 
contest from a reverse auction is that goods or services are delivered before the winner is announced, however only 
the contest winner or winners get paid. Asset-specificity of the efforts implies that the outside option for the goods 
and services produced is zero. Thus, although contests have strong auction flavor, the “bids” made by contestants 
are  sunk  and  the  corresponding  game  of  the  incomplete  information  is  best  described  as  an  all-pay  auction.  For 
example,  our  result  that  a  winner-take-all  contest  is  optimal  for  risk-neutral  agents  can  be  compared  with  a  well-
known  result  that  a  single  share  structure  is  optimal  for  keyword  packaging  auctions  with  risk-neutral  bidders 
assuming  that  the  IHR  (increasing  hazard  rate)  condition  holds  (Chen,  Liu  and  Whinston  2006):  our  result  is 
obtained in a different setting (an “all-pay” auction rather than a regular auction), does not require the IHR condition 
on the distribution of  valuations but  holds only asymptotically, i.e., for contests  with sufficiently large  number of 
participants.  

As we study the crowdsourcing contests, special emphasis is given to the asymptotic analysis of the equilibrium. To 
the best of our  knowledge, this is the first paper to construct and describe distribution-free asymptotics of a large 
scale  all-pay  auction.  The  results  we  obtain  replicate  behavior  of  actual  crowdsourcing  contests,  for  instance,  we 
show  that,  asymptotically,  only  small  neighborhood  of  the  most  efficient  contestant  type  determines  the  contest 
outcome; such neighborhood is essentially identical to the contest core in the Taskcn contests (Yang, Adamic and 
Ackerman 2008). By focusing our analysis on behavior of users in the core, we can provide simple characterization 
of the asymptotically optimal prize structure, in particular,  managerially implementable and easily understood  rule 
of thumb for the optimal division of a budget among multiple prizes. 

In this paper, we extend traditional contest models by modeling a situation where the contest sponsor is interested in 
the quality of one or several best solutions. Our optimality results are most relevant for research/innovation oriented 
contests rather than labor tournaments like sales force contests where sales managers compete for bonuses and the 
firm is interested in the overall level of sales (Kalra and Shi 2001). In particular, our paper can be contrasted with 
the well-known paper of Moldovanu and Sela (2001) that studies optimal allocation of prizes in contests. The main 
difference is that Moldovanu and Sela (2001) consider a contest in which the sponsor is interested in maximizing the

sum of all solutions, but in our setting the outcome of interest is the quality of the top K solutions.  

While acknowledging that research/innovation contests have been extensively studied in the economic literature, we 
argue that our model represents a new contribution to this stream of research that has direct managerial implications 
for Web-based contest design while not compromising on rigor or generality in any way. Taylor (1995) investigates 
optimal design of “golden carrot” contests in which ex-ante identical participants compete to find the solution of the 
highest value to the organizer and the winner receives the specified prize. He finds that free entry in the contest is 
not optimal and the organizer should restrict participation by imposing an entry fee, one that extracts all participant 
surplus.    Similar  conclusions  are  obtained  by  Fullerton  and  McAfee  (1999)  in  a  complete  information  model  of 
innovation  contests  with  heterogeneous  participants.    They  show  that  the  optimal  contest  should  include  only  the 
two “most skilled” competitors and propose using a “contestant selection all-pay auction” before the actual contest 
to select them. There are a few key assumptions that these prior research results rely on. For example, the result of 
Fullerton and McAfee (1999) requires that agents are risk-neutral; Taylor (1995) requires that it is feasible for the 
sponsor  to  appropriate  part  of  the  surplus  via  entry  fees;  Fullerton  and  McAfee  (1999)  require  viability  of  a 
“contestant selection auction” which reveals the contestants' ability prior to the actual development. Although such 
assumptions are adequate for multi-billion dollar military R&D competitions, they seem less suitable for Web-based 
crowdsourcing contests where contestant anonymity and heterogeneity makes complete information unlikely and in 
which  contestants  are  often  budget-constrained  individuals  (rather  than  firms)  who  may  display  significant  risk 
aversion especially with respect to initial losses such as entry fees.4 We argue that these considerations justify the 
need  for  a  very  different  game-theoretic  model  of  Web  contests,  one  that    incorporates  risk-averse  and  budget-
constrained individuals, heterogeneity of expertise in the population, asymmetry of information on the Web and that 
can focus on investigating structure of the equilibrium when the number of participants is large. 

We  conclude  the  introduction  by  highlighting  some  of  our  key  modeling  features  and  salient  results.  Any  good 
model of open Web contests  needs to capture heterogeneity of  “skills” or  “expertise” across the pool of potential 
contestants. We use the word “expertise” in a very broad sense here. It could be, among other things, a proxy for raw 
abilities (talent), or for overall experience in a particular area, or for possession of some rare knowledge or skill, or a 
mix  of  these.  Our  modeling  focus  is  not  on  the  nature  of  this  expertise  but  rather  that  it  is  distributed  across  the 
population.  In a recent paper, Terwiesch and Xu (2008) show that, for expertise-based contests, a free entry in the 
equilibrium  may  or  may  not  be  optimal  depending  on  the  parameters  of  the  expertise  distribution.  Our  paper 
investigates  a  different  but  very  related  question:  “if  entry  in  an  expertise-based  contest  is  free  and  the  contest 
attracts a lot of participants, what is the optimal number of prizes and prize amounts that should be awarded by the 
profit-maximizing sponsor?” Strikingly, the answer is distribution free and depends only on the utility function and 
marginal cost of effort.  

Keeping in mind scenario of a Web contest, the natural modeling approach is to represent the agent's expertise as the 
agent's type in a game of incomplete information. We emphasize that incompleteness of information on opponents' 
expertise is an essential aspect of our model: a very different set of theoretical results will be obtained in a complete 
information setting (Siegel 2009). Note that, in contrast  with some prior articles on the contest design,  we do not 
limit ourselves to studying a single prize, instead  allowing the sponsor to endogenously choose the number of prizes 
as well. We show that when participants are risk-averse, the optimal number of prizes can be strictly greater than the 
number  of  solutions  desired  by  the  sponsor  and  show  that  the  optimal  prize  amounts  exhibit  the  exponentially 
decreasing marginal utility pattern. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The Model section introduces the crowdsourcing contest model and 
provides the basic set of results related to existence and uniqueness of a symmetric Bayesian equilibrium of this kind 
of game. The next section presents the asymptotic results for the equilibrium. In the last part of the paper, we use 
asymptotic techniques to derive the optimal prize structure. The paper concludes with discussion of the results.

For development or research contests with prizes in the thousands or tens of thousands of dollars, running 
the “contestant selection auction” on the Web where the number of potential candidates is huge but willingness to 
bid  of  an  average  candidate  is  very  small  may  also  involve  substantial  transaction  costs  that  can  outweigh  the 
surplus extracted from such auction.

We model a continuum of problem solvers (agents) where agents have hidden type

expertise, with type

precisely, agents are assumed to have a linear cost of effort 
of the agent of the corresponding type. The higher the agent's type, the more effort is needed to realize a particular 
quality level.

N  agents  are  randomly  and  independently  chosen  from  the  pool  to  compete  on  a  single  project.  Agent  types  are 
described  by  the  distribution  function5  Φ   with  the  continuous  probability  density  function  φ.    Each  competing 
agent  can  submit  at  most  one  solution.  The  agent  chooses  her  effort  level,  which  determines  the  quality  q  of  the 
submitted solution. Given the agent's type, there is a deterministic mapping from the effort to the realized quality, 
and  the  agent's  choice  can  thus  be  represented  in  terms  of  their  delivered  quality  q.6  The  contest  sponsor  awards 
monetary prizes M1… ML to the top L (< N) submissions: the agent with the winning submission receives M1, the 
first runner-up receives M2, and so forth.  If there are several submissions of the same quality, ties will be broken 
randomly. All other agents receive no prize, so we adopt a convention that ML+1 = ... = MN = 0. The winner-takes-all 
contest is a particular case of this scenario when L = 1. 

We model possible risk aversion of agents with respect to prizes by introducing a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility 
V M .  When  choosing  quality  level  q  that  induces  a  monetary  lottery  with  prizes  Mi  and  winning 
function 
probabilities pi(q), an agent of type θ will choose to maximize the expected utility

As  nonobservance  of  opponent  skills  is  a  natural  assumption  on  the  Web,  our  contest  is  a  game  of  incomplete 
information, in which the distribution of types  Φ  as well as other parameters of the game are common knowledge, 
however agents do not know types of their competitors. Owing to the similarity of our game to an all-pay auction, 
we will refer to the quality q of an agent's submission as their “bid”. 

Our first proposition establishes that in “fair” crowdsourcing contests, more skilled contestants exert higher effort 
levels.

family  of  functions  Pj(b), j=1..N,  where  Pj(b)  represents  the  probability  of  the  agent  i  winning  the  j-th  prize  after

 Note  that  we  disallow  “atoms”  in  the  skills  distribution.  This  is  not  an  essential  requirement  for  the 
asymptotic analysis unless there is an atom at θ, however it simplifies presentation considerably by ensuring that 
the equilibrium does not involve mixed strategies.

 While it is possible to extend the model to scenarios where solution quality is a stochastic function of the effort 
level, it is beyond the scope of the current paper, as our primary focus is on interplay between diversity of skills, 
private information and risk aversion in the crowdsourcing contests.

Proposition 1 is reassuring in that it ensures that in fair contests, rather than relying on ability and substituting away 
from  effort,  skill  and  effort  are  “complements”,  loosely  speaking.  It  also  shows  that  our  game  satisfies  the  single 
crossing condition for games of incomplete information (Athey 2001). One might be tempted to apply Corollary 2.1 
from  Theorem  2  of  (Athey  2001)  and  conclude  that  there  exists  a  pure  strategy  Bayes-Nash  equilibrium. 
Unfortunately, this corollary requires the ex-post agent's payoff to be continuous with respect to bid, a condition that 
fails  to  hold  for  our  contest.  Although  Section  4  of  (Athey  2001)  considers  auctions  and  other  games  with 
discontinuities, her results do not directly cover all-pay auctions with multiple non-identical prizes, although it might 
be  possible  to  extend  them  to  such  scenario.  Nevertheless,  a  much  simpler  proof  of  existence  follows  from  the 
symmetry of our game as one can derive an ordinary differential equation describing the symmetric equilibrium bid 
function. This approach is similar to analysis of auctions with risk-averse buyers (Maskin and Riley 1984). Because 
we are in a somewhat different setting (multiple prizes), we provide an independent proof.

 is the marginal probability that an agent of type θ places at 

or above the l-th spot and B(x,y) is the Beta function. 

Proof: The full proof is provided in online Appendix. The basic proof strategy is as follows.  First, we know that the  
best  response  function  of  each  agent  is  weakly  monotone  in  her  type.  This  fact  can  be  used  to  show  that,  in  any 
symmetric  pure-strategy  equilibrium,  the  bidding  function  must  be  strictly  decreasing  in  θ,  continuous  and 
differentiable (almost everywhere). The first-order condition for the profit-maximization problem together with the 
boundary condition that type θ bids zero gives integral representation for the bidding function. Uniqueness follows 
from  the fact that any symmetric equilibrium bid function  must  satisfy  the first-order condition and the boundary 
condition. Q.E.D. 

Although the bid equation from Proposition 2 can be used to reconstruct the bid function numerically, it does not say 
much about  strategic behavior of the agents. It is  unclear,  for example, how this behavior  would change if a  new 
prize  is  added,  the  number  of  competitors  grows  or  the  distribution  of  skills  changes.  Fortunately,  the  Envelope

Crowdsourcing with a Large Pool of Contestants: Asymptotic Results 

The bulk of our remaining analysis examine contest outcomes and optimal design of contests when N is large.  We 
start  by  characterizing  the  asymptotic  behavior  of  the  bid  function  as  the  number  of  agents  grows.  For  future 
analytical convenience, we also study the inverse bid function.

. One can  see that bids that are significantly different  from zero  will be produced by 

agents with types “close” to the most efficient type θ and this convergence is of order O(1/N). In other words, all 
significant outcomes will be determined by contestants in a small neighborhood (core) of the most efficient possible 
contestant and this neighborhood shrinks with speed of 1/N as the number of agents grows.  This is a critical insight 
into  the  design  of  crowdsourcing  contests  because  it  suggests  that  the  driver  of  better  outcomes  as  one’s  pool  of 
contestants grows on account of the Web is entirely provided by the greater likelihood of having access to a small 
group of highly qualified individuals competing against each other.

The way to read the curves on Figure 1 is as follows. Assume, for example, that we have a thousand contestants (N 
= 1,000), which is not an unreasonable number for a Web contest. In the symmetric equilibrium for a single prize 
contest (L = 1), submission with quality of 0.9 (90% of the quality produced by the most experienced contestant) 

corresponds to 

bα ≈

( ) 0.1

. The type θ that produces this quality in the equilibrium will be located at

. Thus, there is a four-fold increase in the probability of getting a good outcome that is induced simply by 
introducing  a  second  prize.    This  is  a  simple  example    but  it  produces  very  useful  insight  on  the  value  of  an 
additional prize to the contest sponsor.

We  further  extend  this  idea  by  showing  that  the  first-order  approximation  allows  us  to  calculate  the  asymptotic 
expected  quality  of  the  k-th  submission  for  any  fixed  k:  if  one  fixes  k  and  lets  N  grow,  the  type  of  the  agent 

producing  the  k-th  submission  will  start  approaching  θ,  thus  behaving  as  if

The assumption of a minimum prize amount simplifies the analysis by ruling out optimal pricing schemes 
with “infinite” (function of N) number of prizes and infinitely decreasing prize amounts. Whereas mathematicians 
might  be  interested  in  infinitely  decreasing  prize  amounts,  economists  are  not,  and  so  the  assumption  is 
economically  justified.  One  can  also  think  of  m  as  the  minimum  payment  justifying  the  transfer  of  intellectual 
property as required by law.

Our next proposition establishes that for sufficiently large N solving this approximation problem leads to outcomes 
that are sufficiently close to the  finite-N optimal outcomes so that one can use these asymptotic results to guide the 
actual contest design.

the contribution to of the n-th prize to the n-th outcome is (weakly) the highest. Thus, the relative importance of the 
ranked contributions is aligned with the relative magnitude of the prize amounts.

Several important notes can be made about the results we derived above. At first, while the optimal prize amounts as 
well  as  the  optimal  number  of  prizes  depend  on  the  utility  function  of  contestants  as  well  as  the  contest  sponsor, 
they,  asymptotically,  do  not  depend  on  the  distribution  of  expertise  in  the  population.  At  second,  the  previous 
example  shows  that  the  optimal  number  of  prizes  with  risk  averse  contestants  can  sometimes  be  larger  than  the 
number of  solutions desired  by the sponsor.  At third, the  optimal prize amounts are directly related to the  weight

values Wkj which are exponentially decreasing as a function of the prize number j:  

In  other  words,  having  everything  else  fixed,  starting  at  some  point    every  new  prize  will  have  twice  less 
contribution  to  the  contest  outcome  than  the  prize  immediately  above  it.  That  will  translate  to  the  first  order

conditions,  so  one  will  have 

  as  long  as  the  minimum  prize  constraint  is  not 

binding. What this equation says is that the optimal prizes awarded should follow the following rule of thumb: each 
new prize should have approximately twice higher marginal utility than the prize immediately above it.8 Once  we 
reach a point at which it is not possible to satisfy this relationship, no new prizes should be awarded. Finally, one 
may  compare  the  optimal  prize  scheme  of  the  profit  maximizing  sponsor  with  the  optimal  solution  of  the  social 
planner  that  maximizes  the  expectation  of  the  total  social  surplus.  As  we  know  that,  asymptotically,  the  principal 
expects to extract  the  whole  surplus, it follows that the optimal prize scheme of the profit  maximizing sponsor is 
identical to the optimal prize scheme of the social planner. 

Conclusion 

This  paper  presents  a  theoretical  model  of  an  all-pay  contest  with  heterogeneous  risk-averse  wealth-constrained 
contestants and  multiple prizes. As the  model  was driven primarily by the new phenomenon of Web tournaments 
that  are  known  to  attract  significant  participation,  major  attention  was  given  to  the  asymptotic  properties  of  the 
equilibrium.  Considering  asymptotics  simplifies  the  model  significantly  and  allows  us  to  obtain  a  number  of 
interesting results. 

Consistent with prior empirical studies of crowdsourcing contests (Yang, Adamic and Ackerman 2008), we obtain 
that all significant contest outcomes will be determined by contestants in a small neighborhood (core) of the most

willing to do for an extra dollar. 

 Note that the marginal utility goes down with the prize amount: the higher is the prize amount, the less one is

efficient  possible  contestant  and  this  neighborhood  shrinks  with  speed  of  1/N  as  the  number  of  agents  grows.    In 
particular, asymptotically, only the support of the type distribution and the marginal cost at the support determine 
the  contest  outcome,  therefore  limiting  behavior  of  the  game  has  a  particularly  simple  structure  that  can  be 
summarized by a distribution free core kernel function H.   

Additionally,  we  employ  our  asymptotic  results  to  define  the  asymptotic  optimization  problem  for  the  profit-
maximizing  tournament  sponsor  and  show  that  the  optimal  solution  of  the  finite-sample  allocation  problem 
converges  to  the  asymptotic  one  as  the  number  of  participants  grows.  We  derive  the  optimal  solution  of  the 
asymptotic  optimization  problem.  When  the  contestants  are  sufficiently  risk-averse,  the  firm  may  optimally  offer 
more prizes than there are the desired submissions, thus awarding prizes even to submissions it does not eventually 
want. Moreover, the optimal prize amounts exhibit the exponentially decreasing marginal utility pattern: each new 
prize should have approximately twice higher marginal utility than the prize immediately above it. This is a simple 
but very useful rule of thumb that can be used in the design of real crowdsourcing contests.     

We  also  show  that  all-pay  contests  with  incomplete  information  have  a  number  of  interesting  welfare  properties. 
First,  the  expected  overall  contestant  surplus  (the  expected  total  utility  of  all  contestants)  is  asymptotically  zero. 
That is, asymptotically, the sum of the expected utilities of the eventual winners (the highest K types that receive 
prizes) has exactly the same magnitude as but the opposite sign of the sum of the expected utilities of the remaining 
participants. As one might expect, there is a welfare loss from using these contests relative to the first-best outcome 
under which only the best K participants produce at the socially optimal levels of quality. However, we also show 
that, conditional on using an all-pay contest of the kind we model, the menu of prizes that maximizes the sponsor's 
profits also, asymptotically, maximizes total welfare. Thus, the efficiency news is not all bad.
