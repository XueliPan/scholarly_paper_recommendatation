Abstract—This video is an example of an engineering outreach activity that we designed to illustrate some of 
the core issues in HRI research. High school students attending the University of Washington 2009 Summer 
Math Academy were given a disaster scenario and were asked think about how a robot could help a victim 
who  was  trapped  by  fallen  rubble  during  an  earthquake.  Students  were  led  through  a  series  of  thought 
questions that encouraged them to consider the type of information the robot would need to give to the victim, 
the victim’s family, and the rescue team. They also considered how a victim might respond to a robot, and the 
behaviors  the  robot  should  display  during  the  rescue.  The  students  then  created  a  script  for  the  rescue 
scenario,  writing  not  only  their  own  lines,  but  the  behavior  and  communication  of  the  robot  as  well.  All 
relevant consent forms were obtained from the participants prior to the outreach event.
