ABSTRACT 
A  travelogue  can  be  regarded  as  a  location-oriented  or  scene-
based  document.  Visualizing  a  pure  textual  travelogue  with 
location-based 
to 
understand the main content of the travelogue and  thus share the 
author’s  experience.  Though  a  large  number  of  images  exist  in 
web  albums  such  as  Flickr,  they  are  not  directly,  explicitly 
associated with a travelogue.  In this paper, we propose a general 
framework  and  four  approaches  to  accomplish  the  visualization 
task. The first step of the framework is to extract location names 
and other location-related information from a travelogue (or a set 
of travelogues). In the second step, we use the location names as 
queries to retrieve candidate images together with their tags from 
Flickr.  In  the last  step, the  retrieved  images  are  carefully  refined 
by  using  a  proper  similarity  function.  The  similarity  function 
measures  the  similarity  between  the  travelogue  and  the  tags  of 
each  candidate  Flickr  image.  In  addition  to  the  framework,  our 
main  contributions  lie  in  three  topic  models  which  are  used  for 
computing  the  similarity  functions.  The  models  are  not  only 
adopted  to  visualize  a  single  travelogue  but  also  employed  to 
summarize a collection of travelogues. Experimental results on a 
set  of  Chinese  travelogues  demonstrate  the  proposed  methods’ 
ability to visualize travelogues.

plan  a  trip.  However,  merely  textual  information  tends  to  be  far 
less efficient at conveying what the users expect to see. Moreover, 
it is very difficult for people with different language backgrounds 
to  share  each  other’s  experiences  by  reading  travelogues  written 
in foreign languages. Travelogue visualization is highly expected 
in  this  scenario  to  form  a  visual  guidebook  for  world  users. 
Images  summarizing  a  specific  travelogue  or  common  scenes 
enable  world  users  to  plan  their  trips  and  enjoy  the  world  scene 
more conveniently. 

Travel  has  played  an  increasingly  important  role  in  modern  life, 
and  travelogue  visualization  is  excessively  demanded  for  online 
services.  However,  not  many  research  efforts  have  been  made 
specifically  to  deal  with  this  problem.  Some  related  work 
[1][2][3][4]  center  on  the  issue  of  text-image  matching.  [1]  tried 
to  bridge  the  low-level  visual  features  and  high  level  semantic 
concepts  using  both  textual  information  and  image  features. 
TBAS  [2]  enriched  text  with  images  relying  on  author-uploaded 
images  and  a  pre-trained  Visual  Categorizer  to  extract  metadata 
for  each  image.  [3]  presented  ways  to  enrich  text  with  images 
based  on  both  textual  information  and  visual  features.  [4]  built 
graphical models to link images and text. However, such methods 
usually  suffer  from  the  semantic  gap  between  images  and  text. 
Visual features are usually used to annotate images with low level 
tags  (e.g.  sea,  tree,  and  people).  It  is  very  difficult  to  generate 
descriptive annotations for images employing only visual features. 
In this paper, we skip the gap by using Flickr [5] tags to describe 
the content of the corresponding images. Though tags are usually 
noisy,  a  small  number  of  real  tags  still  exist  to  represent  the 
images  correctly.  Prior  work,  like  [6]  and  [7]  that  focused  on 
Flickr  tag  mining  for  image  annotations  and  location  semantics 
extractions indicates the value of Flickr tags. Still, there has been 
some  work  [8][9][10]  concentrating  on  landmark/scene  image 
selection. [8] and [9] leveraged clustering approaches to diversify 
the landmark image search result. [10] formed a location overview 
by  travelogue  mining  using  a  probabilistic  generative  model. 
These prior work and aforementioned needs inspire and motivate 
the  work  of  a  single  travelogue  visualization  and  summarization 
of a collection of travelogues proposed in this paper. 

The  main  challenge  of  location-based  travelogue  visualization 
using Flickr images associated with tags lies in the inherent noise 
among  tags  and  travelogues.  Authors  of  travelogues  usually 
mention  some  general  information  such  as  transportation  and 
accommodation, 
to  scene-related  descriptions. 
Irrelative tags also  appear  frequently  associated  with  the  images. 
Moreover,  the  gap  between  tags  and  travelogues  cannot  be 
ignored.  Even  if  the  very  detail  has  been  extracted  from 
travelogues  with  no  redundant  words,  it  is  still  possible  that 
corresponding  images  cannot  be  selected.  Because  extracted 

in  addition 

65information does not necessarily exist in the vocabulary of Flickr 
tags.  Besides,  Flickr  tags  are  usually  identical  among  images 
uploaded by the same person, taken at the same time. This means 
textual information can never discriminate one image from others 
in  this  situation.  All  these  facts  bring  grand  challenges  to  the 
formulated problem. 

In this paper, the task of travelogue visualization is fulfilled from 
two  perspectives,  to  meet  the  expectation  of  visual  travelogues 
and virtual scene trips. Four approaches including a baseline  one 
are  presented  to  measure  the  similarity  between  travelogues  and 
tags. These approaches intend to de-noise the travelogues and tags 
respectively  to  decrease  the  inaccuracy  rate.  Meanwhile,  the 
proposed  trade-off  image  ranking  strategy  skips  the  case  when 
different  images  are  associated  with  the  same  tags  and  very 
similar temporal information. 

The  rest  of  this paper  is  organized as  follows.  Section  2  outlines 
the  proposed  framework.  Similarity  measure  methods  and 
implementations are introduced in Section 3. Experimental results 
are shown in Section 4. Section 5 gives conclusions.

2.  FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW 
The  proposed  framework  mainly  consists  of  three  steps:  (1) 
location name extraction, (2) candidate images collection, and (3) 
image  refined 
through  similarity  function.  Especially,  we 
introduce  four  approaches  for  similarity  measure:  a  baseline 
method, log-model, log-tag model, and tag model. Moreover, two 
forms  of  input  make  it  possible  for  both  travelogue  visualization 
and  summarization  for  collections  of  travelogues.  The  overview 
of 
travelogue 
summarization is shown in Figure 1. 

travelogue  visualization  and  collections  of 

In  the  first  two  steps,  candidate  images  associated  with  tags  are 
collected through trigging the Flickr search engine with the scene 
or  the  location  name  as  the  query.  Following  that,  as  showed  in 
Figure  1,  different  forms  of  input  makes  the  travelogue  to  be 
visualized  from  two  perspectives.  With  a  single  travelogue  as 

input,  the  output  of  the  proposed  framework  is  expected  to  be 
images  that  accurately  represent  the  visual  content  of  the 
travelogue.  Two  travelogues  describing  a  common  scene  from 
different  aspects  are  desired  to  be  visualized  using  different 
images. With a number of travelogues describing a common scene 
as  input,  output  images  are  desired  to  re-create  their  common 
scene visually.  

Further,  we  measure  the  similarity  between  travelogues  and  tags 
associated  with  candidate  images.  Four  approaches,  i.e.,  the 
baseline approach, the log-model approach, the log-tag co-model 
approach, and the tag-model approach are presented to fulfill the 
task.  It  is  noted  that  inputs  of  different  patterns  share  common 
measure  approaches.  Details  about  the  proposed  approaches  are 
introduced in the following section.  

Finally,  images  are  ranked  based  on  the  scores  obtained  from 
similarity  measure  module.  For  images  with  tied  scores,  within 
the same album and taken at similar time, we randomly select one 
image among them to visualize the travelogue. Besides, for single 
travelogue  visualization, 
temporal 
information  provided  by  travelogues  will  be  excluded.  In  this 
paper,  a  year  is  divided  into  two  time  periods.  From  October  to 
March in the next year is the first period, and the left months are 
grouped into the second period. If an image is taken at one period 
and  the  travelogue  is  written  in  the  other,  the  image  will  be 
excluded from the candidate image set of the travelogue.

3.  SIMILARITY MEASURE 
Similarity  measure  is  the  major  part  of  the  proposed  framework, 
and the whole similarity measure process is shown in Figure 2. If 
the  input  travelogue  is  denoted  as  𝑣 ,  and  tags  of  each  image 
among  candidate  images  are  represented  as 𝑡𝑖,  candidate  images 
are  ranked  according  to  𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦(𝑣, 𝑡𝑖) .  In  the  following 
subsections, we start with the baseline approach, and later present 
further  three  advanced  topic  models  to  calculate 𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦(𝑣,
𝑡𝑖).  
3.1  Baseline Approach 
The  baseline  approach  is  simply  a  word-to-word  matching 
approach.  The  case  when  a  word  appears  in  the  travelogue  and 
simultaneously  appears  in  tags  associated  with  one  image  is 
referred  to  as  ―matched‖.  After  removing  location  names  and 
scenic  spots,  for  each  candidate  image,  we  will  calculate  how 
many times its associated tags match the words in the travelogue. 
The number of matched tags associated with each image indicates 
the  extent  to  which  this  image  is  correlated  with  the  input 
travelogue.  If  the  tags  associated  with  an  image  appear  more 
frequently than others in the travelogue, this image is ranked top.  

It  is  evident  to  find  the  limitation  of  this  approach.  Candidate 
images with a large number of tags tend to earn high scores, while 
images with a small collection of tags ranked low. The fact makes 
this approach inaccurate when tags along with ideal images are in 
small number. The example travelogue visualization results using 
this method are shown in the following section. 

3.2  Log-Model 
The log-model aims to train a generative model on travelogues to 
remove  noisy  words from  the travelogues  and  improve  matching 
accuracy.  In  this  paper,  we  apply  the  model  proposed  in  [10]  to 
extract  latent  global  topics  (i.e., 𝑧𝑔𝑙 )  and  local  topics  (i.e., 𝑧𝑙𝑜𝑐 ). 
Global  topics  are  commonly  shared  by  many  locations,  while 
local  topics  refer  to  typical  characteristics  of  a  few  specific

This  method  is  especially  useful  to  extract  location-
related information which is desired to visualize. 

The  model  was  built  on  a  vocabulary  of  29K  words,  and  20K 
travelogues  written  in  Chinese.  The  topic-specific  distributions 
over  words,  { 𝑝(𝑤|𝑧) },  are  estimated  after  training.  Given  a 
travelogue 𝑑𝑛𝑒𝑤 , its distribution over topics 𝑝 𝑧 𝑑𝑛𝑒𝑤   is inferred 
using the EM algorithm. Top words (i.e., words with the highest 
probabilities)  of  each  local  topic  are  then  gathered  together  to 
represent  the  original  travelogue.  Finally,  the  score  of  each 
candidate image is measured in terms of the similarity between its 
tags and the travelogue, denoted by 𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦(𝑣, 𝑡𝑖).  

information 

3.3  Log-Tag Co-model  
As aforementioned, local topics help to filter out noise and extract 
location-related 
from  noisy  and  unstructured 
travelogues. Top-ranked  words  in  such  topics  are  then combined 
to represent the travelogue. The problem is that top-ranked words 
of a topic are usually synonyms, like ―树‖, ―树木‖ and ―树林‖. If 
this  occurs,  images  with  tags  of  ― 树 ‖  will  be  scored  three 
according to a word-to-word matching principle. The visualization 
results  will  definitely  lead  to  a  bias  towards  images  with  a  tag 
―树‖. In fact, it is likely that ―树木‖ or “树林‖ only involves in 
the travelogue vocabulary, but does not appear in tag vocabulary 
at all.  

Log-tag  co-model  introduced  here  is  to  narrow  the  gap  between 
the vocabulary of travelogues and tags. We define a weight vector 
as follows: 

𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑖  =    

𝑡

1 − 𝑡

𝑖 ∈ 𝑡𝑎𝑔 𝑣𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑦
𝑖  ∉ 𝑡𝑎𝑔 𝑣𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑟𝑎𝑦

 ,            (1) 

𝑝 𝑤 𝑧𝑖  = 𝑝 𝑤 𝑧  × 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑖 ,                      (2) 

where 𝑡 ∈ [0,1],  and  we  let 𝑡 = 1 in  this  paper.  This  way,  words 
used  to  represent  the  semantic  meaning  of  the  travelogue  are 
further  refined.  Visualization  results  improve  or  at  least  hold  the 
line with the approach mentioned in subsection 3.2. 

3.4  Tag-Model  
Tag-model approach aims to de-noise the unrelated words in tags 
𝑁  of 
via  offline  trained  pLSA  model  [11]  for  tag  sets 𝐃 =  t𝑖 𝑖=1
each  scene.  For  images  with  few  tags,  this  model  is  expected  to 
expand  synonyms  tags.  In  this  way,  images  can  be  better 
expressed  through  tags.  Different  from  above  similarity  measure 
strategies,  tag-model  strategy  intends  to  compare  the  similarity 
between  the  travelogues  and  tags  on  a  topic  space,  i.e., 
𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦(𝑝 𝑧 𝑣 , 𝑝(𝑧|𝑡𝑖)). 
This strengthens the proposed framework in dealing with the bias 
problem: images with more tags tend to be assigned higher scores. 
Moreover,  this  approach  is  more  suitable  for  visualization  of 
collections  of  travelogues,  because  the  vocabulary  consists  of  all 
the  tags.  By  contrast,  in  a  single  travelogue,  the  extracted 
information  is  difficult  to  match  with  the  Flickr  tags.  But 
collections  of  travelogues  comparatively  involve  more  tags  that 
are gathered together and form a complete description of a certain 
scene.  Moreover,  the  topics  learned  from  this  model  are  more 
diverse for scenes insensitive to locations (e.g., 北京奥运 (Beijing 
Olympic), 古城 (Ancient City)). 

4.  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
To  summarize  the  travelogues  using  images,  we  downloaded 
100G  images  from  Flickr,  together  with  tags  and  timestamps. 
Only  if  the  image’s  title,  tag  or  description  contains  the  specific 
scene  name,  it  was  downloaded.  Moreover,  we  collected  20K 
travelogues from [12]. In the following subsections, experimental 
results for visualization of single travelogue and summarization of 
collections of travelogues are reported. 
4.1  Single Travelogue Visualization 
To  evaluate  the  proposed  approaches  for  single  travelogue 
visualization,  50  example  travelogues  with  associated  images 
were collected from [5]. The associated images are considered as 
ground-truth 
the  proposed 
framework  share  some  visual  similarity  with  the  ground-truth 
images,  they  are  considered  to  be  satisfied  results.  Ten  graduate 
students were asked to score for both the visualization results and 
the  ground-truth  images.  The  score  indicates  the  similarity 
between  images  and  travelogue  context.  The  following  two 
travelogues,  with  their  visualization  results  scored  higher  than 
others, can be found from:

67The  visualization  results  for  above-mentioned  two  travelogues 
under the proposed framework are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, 
respectively.  To  make  the comparison  convenient,  the  associated 
ground-truth images are shown in the middle, and results of other 
four approaches are displayed around. Clearly, although these two 
pieces of travelogues both portray the same location of ―Tibetans 
(香格里拉)‖,  images  shown  vary  deeply.  Figure  3  indicates  that 
the travelogue describes forest and life in Tibetans, while Figure 4 
illustrates  scenes  of  snow  mountain  in  Tibetans.  The  images 
generated  by  the  proposed  framework  summarize  the  two 
travelogues  from  two  clearly  different  aspects,  which  reveal  the 
differences  between  textual  descriptions.  This  demonstrates  the 
effectiveness  of  single  travelogue  visualization.  Further,  log-tag 
co-model  outperforms  other  three  approaches  as  its  resulting 
images are the most similar to the ground-truth. 
4.2  Collections of Travelogue Summarization 
We  took  the  scene  of  ―Olympic  Games‖,  ―Ancient  City‖,  ―Li 
Jiang‖, ―Tibetans‖, and ―Forbidden City‖ as examples to show the 
results  of 
the  proposed  framework  on  summarization  of 
collections of travelogues. Still, we ask ten graduates to score for 
the results. Score results show that tag-model approach surpasses 
log-model  in  summarization  of  travelogue  collections.  Taking 
―Olympic  Games‖  as  an  example,  we  built  tag-model  on  tags 
associated  with  3184  images  and  800  words.  Top  words  in  the 
example  topics  are  shown  in  Table  1.  A  collection  of  1463 
travelogues  related  to  Olympic  Games  was  projected  onto  this 
topic  space.  Table  2  shows  the  top  words  in  the  selected  local 
topics  in  log-model.  We  can  see  that  words  listed  in  Table  2 are 
less  diverse  and  expressive  than  ones  in  Table  1.  Diverse  tags

5.  CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we present a framework for travelogue visualization 
using  topic  models.  Our  framework  focuses  on  the  similarity 
measure approaches between a given travelogue and tags of each 
candidate  image.  Besides  the  framework,  we  propose  four 
approaches to calculate the similarity respectively, and images are 
refined  due  to  the  similarity  measure  results  and  temporal 
information.  Experiments  with  a  pool  of  Flickr  images,  tags  and 
user-generated  travelogues  demonstrate  the  potential  of  the 
proposed framework for location-relevant travelogue visualization.
