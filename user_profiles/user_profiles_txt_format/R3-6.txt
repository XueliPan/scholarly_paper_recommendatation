Abstract 

Searching  an organization’s  document  repositories  for 
experts  is  a  frequently  occurred  problem  in  intranet 
information  management.  A  common  method  for  finding 
experts  in  an  organization  is  to  use  social  networks  – 
people are not isolated but connected by various kinds of 
associations.  In  organizations,  people  explicitly  send 
email to one another thus social networks are likely to be 
contained in the patterns of communication. Moreover, in 
some  web  pages,  the  relationship  among  people  is  also 
recorded.  In  our  approach  we  propose  several  strategies 
in discovering the associations among people from emails 
and  web  pages.  Based  on  the  social  networks,  we 
proposed  an  expertise  propagation  algorithm:  from  a 
ranked list of candidates according to their probability of 
being  expert  for  a  certain  topic,  we  select  a  small  set  of 
the  top  ones  as  seed,  and  then  use  the  social  networks 
among the candidates to discover other potential experts. 
The  experiments  on  TREC  enterprise 
track  show 
significant performance improvement with the algorithm. 
 
1.  Introduction 
 

When  locating  some  desired  information  or  source  of 
knowledge,  one  can  usually  be  satisfied  by  finding  an 
expert  in  the  topic  of  interest.  Thus  finding  experts  in  a 
particular area is a frequently encountered problem within 
any commercial, educational or government organization.  
Yet the very problem of discovering who knows  what 
is  often  challenging,  we  could  build  up  a  relationship 
between a query and an expert via documents. Plus, social 
networks  — 
in  an 
organization  —  provide  another  opportunity  for  finding 
experts.  People  is  not  isolated  but  connected.  When  we 
locate  someone  as  an  expert,  those  candidates  who  have 
strong  relationship  with  him  are  much  possible  to  be 
experts too. 

relationships  among  people 

and  the  patterns  of  communication  contain  information 
about who knows  what in an organization. Web pages in 
the  organizations  provide 
repository  of 
information  that  can  be  utilized  to  build  the  social 
network.  As  such  it  contains  precious  information  about 
events, activities, works and interests of individuals.  

another 

In  our  previous  work  [1]  we  proposed  a  method 
associating  candidates  with  documents  to  quantitatively 
estimating  the  individual  expertise.  In  this  paper,  we 
concentrate  on  estimating 
the  associations  among 
candidates  to  build  a  social  network  and  introduce  an 
expertise  propagation  algorithm  to  help  re-rank  the 
expertise probabilities of the candidates to the given query. 
Under  the  algorithm,  a  candidate  can  acquire  extra 
expertise  probability  from  a  reliable  expert  who  has 
strong  relationship  with  the  candidate.  The  goal  of  this 
paper  described  here  is  to  examine  the  various  kinds  of 
associations among candidates.

P c q  according to 
describe the approach of estimating 
the association between the candidates and the content of 
the documents, which we refer as stage1. There is another 
kind  of  association  which  is  among  the  candidates 
themselves.  People  is  not  isolated  but  connected.  The 
connection  among  candidates  can  be  identified  through 
document  analysis,  such  as  those  members  in  a  same 
interest  group  may  communicate  frequently  through 
emails  and  the  candidates  who  publish  a  technical report 
may  appear  as  co-authors.  The  associations  among 
identifying  experts

 with  him  is  also 
quite likely to be an expert.

In  enterprise  corporation  there  are  a  lot  of  sources  of 
information  can  be  utilized  to  mine  the  relationship 
among the people. Email is a valuable source of expertise 
according to the fact that email is used widely today as a 
major means of communication. Both the content of email

Thus we introduce an expertise propagation process for

most likely to be the experts from the stage 1 as the seed. 
Then,  expecting  that  those  candidates  who  have  strong 
associations  with  the  experts  are  also  experts,  we  assign 
the  expertise  score  from  the  experts  in  S  to  those 
candidates.

where βcontrols how much the effect reacts. In this case, 
the  actual  propagation  score  of 
yc will  be  the  sum  of  the 
score fractions received through his associated candidates 
in  S.  Intuitively,  the  more  expertise  scores  a  candidate 
accumulates,  the  more  probable  that  he  is  expert.  The 
above  algorithm  is  very  similar 
to  PageRank  [2]. 
However,  PageRank  is  based  on  a  mutual  reinforcement 
between  pages  and  the  score  is  computed  iteratively  to 
convergence. But for expertise propagation the candidates 
are only influenced by those ones in the seed. 
 
3. Building associations among candidates  
 

As  we  stated  in  the  introduction,  we  hope  to  find  the 
relationships  between  the  candidates  both  from  the  web 
pages and email messages. We represent the organization 
whose corpora we study as a graph. The nodes correspond 
to candidates and the edges correspond to the strength of 
the associations among the people. In web pages persons 
co-occur in some local context may indicate that they are 
related  under  some  topic  while  the  existence  of  email 
correspondence  also  denotes  the  potential  association 
among the people. 

Through the analysis of the graph we can quantify the 
strength of the association between two people. A higher 
strength indicates that the two people have more common 
interest and more frequent communication.  
 

3.1. Web pages-based Social network  
 
To  build  the  social network  from  web  pages,  we  assume 
that people co-occur in a range of local context may share 
similar interest. Therefore an intuitive way of quantifying 
the  strength  of  the association  between  two  candidates is 
to count their co-occurrence in a document. We formalize 
the notion of co-occurrence of two candidates 
xc and yc in 
a document d by a binary function CO over all documents 
in the web pages collection: 

CO c c d

   (4)

= ∑

d

However,  the  co-occurrence  function  defined  above  is 
not delicate enough to represent the association precisely. 
Since there may be many topics within one document, the 
further the distance between the two candidates is the less 
probable  that  they  are  under  the  same  topic.  This 
observation  suggests  that  we  weaken  the  strength  of  the 
association as  candidates  separate  away  from  each  other. 
To  achieve  this  we  describe  the  possible  scheme  that 
employing the reciprocal of the number of words between 
the occurrences as co-occurrence strength.  
 
3.2. Email communication-based Social network  
 

We  propose  several  strategies  to  build  the  association 
the  analysis  of  email 

through 

among  candidates 
communication patterns.  

The  simplest  way  of  estimating  the  strength  of 
connection between two candidates is to count the amount 
xc and yc  
of  their  email  correspondence.  The  candidates 
are associated if they appear together in the from, to or cc 
field  of  an  email  e.  We  introduce  a  binary  function 
yc  ,e)  (Email  Connection)  to  represent  their

Email messages  form  a thread tree  structure. The root 
of  the  thread  tree  is  the  first  message  sent  by  some 
candidate and then the thread tree expands as other people 
reply to this message or forward to others to continue the 
discussion.  Since  more  candidates  are  involved  in  email 
threads,  consider  associating  candidates  appearing  in  the 
same email thread can tackle the problem that sometimes 
the  email  connection  matrix  built  merely  through  single 
message  is  sparse.  Similarly,  we  use  binary  function

mixture model. 
 
3.3. Query dependent social network  
 

The  graphs  built  above  reflect  the  static  relationship 
among candidates, which is query independent. However, 
with  the  query  topics  involved  we  can  build  a  query 
dependent  social  network  among  the  candidates.  In  this 
situation,  the  documents  adopted  to  generate  social 
network  are  not  from  the  whole  collection.  In  stead  we 
calculate  the  associations  from  those  web  pages  and 
emails  relevant  to  the  query  topic.  This  query  dependent 
social network  is  appealing  because  it  focuses  merely  on 
the associations which are related to the desired topic. For 
example, if one candidate is the expert in different realms 
including  the  desired  one,  the  candidates  to  whom  we 
want  to  assign  expertise  score  are  those  communicating 
much with him on the required topic.  

Moreover,  we  could  better  evaluate  the  strength  of 
association by employing the similarity of the documents 
to  the  query.  This  is  based  on the  following  assumption: 
the  more  relevant  to  query  the  document  that  joins  the 
candidates  is,  the  stronger  association  exists  among  the 
candidates. Thus we replace the binary function with CO 
EC and  TC  with numerical  function in  which the  weight 
is the similarity of the document to the query.  
 
4. Experiment and discussion 
 

Our  CDD-based  search  model  is  evaluated  on  the 
dataset  adopted  in  TREC  enterprise  track  2005  and 
2006[3].  The  collection  is  a  crawl  of  the  public  W3C 
(*.w3c.org)  sites,  including  Web  pages  and  Email  lists. 
We  took  the  topics adopted  by  the  expert  finding task  of 
TREC. The main evaluation measures used for the expert 
finding task is mean average precision (MAP).

The baseline of our experiment is the best results in the 
stage 1 as described in [1]. For the expertise propagation 
process,  there  are  some  free  parameters  to  be  estimated, 
for  instance,  the  size  of  the  seed  N.  In  this  part,  we 
empirically tune the parameters to the best on the training 
topics and then test on the rest topics. Table 1 shows the 
results  the  expertise  propagation under  different  kinds  of 
social  network,  including  co-occurrence  association  CO 
and communication association EC and TC.

We  see  that  the  co-occurrence  association  outperforms 
the  baseline  over  the two  topics  set,  which  indicates  that 
CO is helpful in identifying that persons often co-occur in 
the context as a group. And the performance gap between 
the  association  CO  in  equation  4  and  the  distance 
weighted  CO  (DW  CO)  confirms  our  assumption  that 
there  are  multi  topics  in  one  document  and  associating 
candidates  who  are  far  from  each  other  may  cause  the 
topic drift problem. 

The  expertise  propagation  using  social  network  built 
through  analysis  of  email  communication  also  performs 
well. The reason lies in the fact as stated in [4] that Chen 
et  al  calculate  the  clustering  coefficient  [5]  of  the  email 
network  in  W3C.  The  clustering  coefficient  is  0.267, 
which is much larger than the clustering coefficient of the 
comparative 
is 
0.00041.  It  indicates  that  the  mail  network  is  highly 
clustered and our experiment approves the fact. However, 
we can observe that the improvement of query dependent 
social  network

4.2. The role of the seed  
 

In  expertise  propagation  algorithm,  the  candidates  in 
the  set  of  seed  will  assign  expertise  probability  to  other 
candidates  who  are  related  to  them.  Thus  one  crucial 
parameter  in  expertise  propagation  process  is  how  many 
candidates would be selected as the seed set. Varying the 
number of candidates allow us to evaluate the effect of the 
seed on the test sets. The curves shown in Figure 1 reflect 
the variation caused by number N.

the  performance  is  enhanced  until αis  close  to  1,  which 
suggests  that  the  thread  connection  effect  should  be 
highly  emphasized  to  optimize  the  performance.  This 
phenomenon may  be  still due  to  the  sparse  data  problem 
as  stated  in  the  previous  section  that  the  email  threads 
associate more candidates than email messages do.

resources:  on  one  hand,  people  explicitly  send  email  to 
one  another  thus  the  relationship  are  likely  to  be 
contained  in the  patterns  of  communication;  on the  other

problem  of  reducing  the  influence  of  the  noises  in  the 
seed  to  the  expertise  propagation.  We  also  plan  to 
investigate  other  kinds  of  potential  association  among 
people  and  to  combine  the  current  associations  into  a 
general social network.

the size of the seed. This can be explained by the fact that 
both of the social networks built are sparse: among 46059

4.3. The role of weights estimation 
 

the 

The intensity of the expertise propagation is controlled 
by  the  weight  parameter  β in  equation  2.  In  our 
experiments,  we  do not  use  training  methods  to  optimize 
the weights automatically, in stead we tune it empirically 
on two topic sets to reveal and validate the impact of the 
intensity.  We  vary  the  value  of  the  parameter β and 
record  the  performance  at  each  parameter  value.  The 
results show that the insufficient intensity is more harmful 
than  over  emphasizing  the  expertise  propagation  effect. 
How  to  keep  balance  between  the  two  aspects  is  crucial 
and  the  empirical results  show  that  setting  βfrom  0.1  to 
0.3 is beneficial.
