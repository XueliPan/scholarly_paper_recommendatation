Abstrat. We study Eulidean embeddings of Eulidean metris and

present the following four results: (1) an O(log

tion for minimum bandwidth in onjuntion with a semi-de(cid:12)nite relax-

ation, (2) an O(log

straint set, (3) a lower bound of (cid:2)(

log n) on the least possible volume

distortion for Eulidean metris, (4) a new embedding with O(

distortion of point-to-subset distanes.

1 Introdution

The minimum bandwidth problem asks for a permutation of the verties of an

undireted graph that minimizes the maximum di(cid:11)erene between the endpoints

of its edges. This maximum di(cid:11)erene is alled the bandwidth. Minimizing the

bandwidth is NP-hard [5℄.

The question of (cid:12)nding good approximations to the minimum bandwidth has

led to two di(cid:11)erent Eulidean embeddings of graphs. One of them is obtained

as a solution to a semi-de(cid:12)nite relaxation of the problem [1℄. The other is an

embedding that preserves tree volumes of subsets of a given metri [3, 4℄. The

tree volume of a subset is the produt of the edge lengths of a minimum spanning

tree of the subset. These two embeddings were used in separate approximation

algorithms.

In this paper we ombine the two embeddings to obtain an improved approx-

imation. The quality of the approximation is O((cid:26) log

n) where (cid:26) is the best

2:5

possible volume distortion (de(cid:12)ned in setion 2) of a Eulidean metri. Using

p

Rao's upper bound [6℄ of O(

log n log log n) on (cid:26) we obtain an approximation

guarantee of O(log

n

log log n) whih improves on [4℄ by a fator of (cid:2)(

log n).

p

Our approah immediately leads to the question of whether a better up-

p

per bound is possible. In setion 5, we show a lower bound of (cid:10) (

log n) on

the volume distortion even for the path graph. Thus further improvements to

bandwidth approximation will have to ome from other avenues.

We then turn to the general question of embedding metris in Eulidean

spae. Finding an embedding of a metri that \preserves" properties of the orig-

inal metri is a lassial problem. A natural property to onsider in this regard

is the original distane funtion itself. J. Bourgain [2℄ gave an embedding that

2

ahieves a distortion of O(log n) for any metri on n points, i.e. the distane

between points in the embedding is within a fator of O(log n) of their distane

in the metri. In other words, it \preserves" distanes any point and any an-

other point. A natural generalization would be an embedding that preserves the

distane between any point and any subset of points. The distane of a point u

to a subset of points S , is simply the distane of u to the losest point in S . For

a Eulidean embedding, the distane of a point u to a subset S an be de(cid:12)ned

as the Eulidean distane from u to the onvex hul l of S . Thus point-to-subset

distane is a diret generalization of point-to-point distane for metris as well

as for points in Eulidean spae. In setion 6, we give an embedding whose point-

p

to-subset distortion is O(

log n) for any Eulidean metri where the shortest

distane is within a poly(n) fator of the longest distane.

Replaing \onvex" in the de(cid:12)nition above by \aÆne" leads to another in-

teresting property. In setion 6 we observe that for any Eulidean embedding,

the distortion of aÆne point-to-subset distanes is also an upper bound on its

volume distortion. In setion 7, we formulate a new system of onstraints that

are separable in O(n

) time, and whih result in an O(log

n) approximation

log n

3

to the minimum bandwidth using the results of setion 6. We onlude with

the onjeture that our embedding (setion 6.1) ahieves the optimal volume

distortion for Eulidean metris.

2 Eulidean Embeddings of Metris

Let G = (V ; E ) be a (cid:12)nite metri with distane funtion d(u; v). We restrit

our attention throughout the paper to Eulidean embeddings (cid:30) of G that are

ontrations, i.e. the distanes between embedded points are at most the origi-

nal distanes. As mentioned in the introdution, the distortion of a ontration

embedding, (cid:30)(G), is

d(u; v)

max

u;v2V

j(cid:30)(u) (cid:0) (cid:30)(v)j

where j (cid:1) j is the Eulidean distane (L

norm). A Eulidean metri on n points is

2

a metri that is exatly realizable as the distanes between n points in Eulidean

The Tree Volume (Tvol) of a metri is the produt of the edge lengths of the

minimum spanning tree. A subset S of a metri also indues a metri, and its

tree volume, T vol(S ) is the produt of the edges of the minimum spanning tree

of the metri indued by S .

The Eulidean Volume (Evol) of a subset of points fx

Remark. The fator (k (cid:0) 1)! in the denominator is a normalization that

onnets volume of a simplex to volume of a parallelepiped. The distortion as

de(cid:12)ned above is within a fator of 2 of the distortion as de(cid:12)ned in [3, 4℄. We (cid:12)nd

it unneessary to go through the notion of \best possible volume" (Vol) used

there.

The following theorem, due to Rao [6℄, onnets the tree volume with Eu-

lidean volume for the speial ase of Eulidean metris.

Theorem 1. For any Eulidean metri G, there exists a Eulidean embedding

p

(cid:30)(G) whose k-volume distortion is O(

log n log log n) for al l k up to log n.

3 A Semi-De(cid:12)nite Relaxation

To arrive at the semi-de(cid:12)nite relaxation of [1℄, we an start by imagining that

the points of the graph are arranged along a great irle of the sphere at regular

intervals spanning an ar of 90 degrees as in Figure 1. This is our approximation

of laying out all the points on a line, and it is good to within a fator of 2. We relax

this to allow the points to wander around the sphere, but maintaining that no two

lie more than 90 degrees apart, and that they satisfy the \spreading" onstraints.

The ob jetive funtion for our relaxation is to minimize the maximum distane

between any pair of points onneted by an edge in the original graph. We now

give the SDP expliitly, where G = (V ; E ) is our original graph. Note that G

does not neesarily indue a Eulidean metri, but the solution to the SDP

below, where the vetors orrespond to verties of G, does indue a Eulidean

metri. It is shown in [1℄ that this is a relaxation and that it an be solved in

polytime.

We need to onsider only O(n

log n) intervals of length

(the longest

distane is O(n) originally, and by lemma 2, it maps to a distane of at most

O(n

log n) with high probability). Now by Markov's inequality, with high prob-

ability, the number of k subsets that fall in any interval of length

is at most

lower bound on the bandwidth of the graph (the distane between the solution

vetors of the SDP is a lower bound and this distane is only ontrated during

the volume-preserving embedding).

After the last step, with high probability the distane between the pro jetions

of v

and v

is at most O(

Thus the maximum number of intervals of length

that the bandwidth of the (cid:12)nal ordering is O((cid:26) log

5 A Lower Bound on Volume Distortion

Our bandwidth algorithm and its analysis motivate the question of whether there

are embeddings with better volume distortion. In this setion we show that even

p

for a path on n verties, the best possible volume distortion is (cid:10) (

log n). Thus a

further improvement in bandwidth approximation will have to ome from other

soures.

Theorem 3. Let G be a path on n verties. Then for any Eulidean embedding

of G, the distortion for subsets of size up to k is (cid:10) ((log n)

). For k =

1=2(cid:0)1=k

(cid:10) (log log n), the distortion is (cid:10) ((log n)

).

We begin by proving that the distortion is (cid:10) ((

and let P

6 Embeddings Preserving Point-To-Subset Distanes

The distane of a point (or vertex) u of G to a subset of points S is simply

d(u; S ) = min

d(u; v). For points in Eulidean spae, let us de(cid:12)ne the distane

v2S

of a point u to a set of points S as the minimum distane from u to the onvex

hul l of S , whih we denote with the natural extension of j (cid:1) j. We denote the

onvex hull of a set of points S by onv(S ), and the aÆne hull by a(cid:11)(S ).

De(cid:12)nition 2. The point-to-subset distortion of an embedding (cid:30)(G) is

max

d(u; S )

u2V ;S(cid:26)V

j(cid:30)(u) (cid:0) onv((cid:30)(S ))j

In this setion we investigate the question of the best possible point-to-subset

distortion of a Eulidean metri. Besides its geometri appeal, the question has

the following motivation. Suppose we replaed \onvex" in the de(cid:12)nition above

by \aÆne" and alled the related distortion the aÆne point-to-subset distortion.

Then we would have the following onnetion with volume distortion.

Lemma 5. Let (cid:30)(G) be a ontration embedding of a metri G. Then the aÆne

point-to-subset distortion is an upper bound on the k-volume distortion, for al l

2 (cid:20) k (cid:20) n.

Proof of lemma 5. Consider a set S of verties in G, and a mimimum spanning

tree T of S . Consider any leaf u of T . If the point-to-subset distortion of our

embedding (cid:30) is (cid:12) , then

We now state our main theorem on point-to-subset distortion. In the next

ut

two subsetions, we de(cid:12)ne the embedding, and then prove that the embedding

satis(cid:12)es the theorem.

Theorem 4. For any Eulidean metri G where the shortest distane is within

a poly(n) fator of the longest distane, there exists a Eulidean embedding (cid:30)(G)

whose point-to-subset distortion is O(

log n).

6.1 The Embedding

Let G = (V ; E ) be a Eulidean metri with distanes (edge lengths) d(u; v) for

all pairs of verties u; v 2 V . We assume that all the distanes lie between 8 and

8n. (Any polynomial upper bound on the ratio of the shortest to the longest

distane would suÆe). Sine G is Eulidean, we an assume without loss of

generality that the verties are points in some d-dimensional Eulidean spae.

Given only the distanes, it is trivial to (cid:12)nd points realizing the distanes by

solving an SDP. The embedding we now desribe was inspired by the work of

Rao [6℄.

Before de(cid:12)ning the embedding in general, let us onsider the following illus-

trative example. Suppose that d = 1, i.e., all the points lie on a line. In this

ase, we ould proeed by generating oordinates aording to the following ran-

dom proess: for eah R in the set f1; 2; 2

; : : : ; 2

g, we repeat the following

2

blog n

proedure N times: hoose eah point from the subset f1; : : : ; 8ng with prob-

ability 1=R for inlusion in a set S , and ome up with a oordinate (cid:30)

(v) for

S

every v 2 V . The oordinate (cid:30)

(v) is de(cid:12)ned to be min

jv (cid:0) wj, and then

S

w2S

(cid:30)(v) is the vetor given by the set of oordinates for v . This will yield N log n

oordinates.

p

We now explain why this yields a

log n aÆne point-to-subset distortion.

This is a stronger property than

log n point-to-subset distortion, and it will

only be proved for d = 1. Consider a set U (cid:26) V and a point u, with distane

on the line d(u; U ). For every S , we have that j(cid:30)

(u) (cid:0) a(cid:11)((cid:30)

(U ))j (cid:20) d(u; U ),

S

and it is a simple appliation of Cauhy-Shwarz to get that j(cid:30)(u) (cid:0) a(cid:11)((cid:30)(U ))j (cid:20)

d(u; U )

N log n. To obtain a lower bound of (cid:10) (d(u; U )

largest R suh that R (cid:20) d(u; U ). Denote this value of R by r; we now show

that with onstant probability, a set S hosen by inluding points in S with

probability

yields j(cid:30)

(u) (cid:0) a(cid:11)((cid:30)

(U ))j = (cid:10) (d(u; U )). We get this from the

and to the right of u, pik the rest of the points not near u with probability

S

for this last point inluded in S is (cid:10) (d(u; U )) with onstant probability. Feige

proves [4℄ that the number of \distint" aÆne ombinations is not too great,

and thus taking N suÆiently large, but still polynomial, yields that this ours

with high probability simultaneously for all \distint" aÆne ombinations, and

thus over the unountable set of all aÆne ombinations. Taking N a little bit

larger still (but still polynomial) then yields that this is simultaneously true for

all point-subset pairs.

For the general ase (d (cid:21) 1), our algorithm hooses a random line, pro jets

all the points to this random line, and then omputes the oordinates as above.

In detail, for eah R in the set f1; 2; 2

; : : : ; 2

g, we repeat the following

Thus the total number of dimensions is O(N log n). For the same reasons as

ited above, N = poly(n) will suÆe. Thus the dimension of the (cid:12)nal embedding

is polynomial in n.

6.2 The Proof

We (cid:12)rst upper bound the point-to-subset distanes in our (cid:12)nal embedding. Con-

sider any point u and subset U . It is enough to onsider the point v 2 U mini-

mizing d(u; v) by the following lemma.

Lemma 6. For every pair u; v 2 V ,

Proof. After saling up by a fator of

d, we have that for any pair u; v 2 V ,

where step 6 is true with onstant probability for a single random line, and with

very high probability when summing over all the random lines.

Sine j(cid:30)(u) (cid:0) onv((cid:30)(U ))j (cid:20) j(cid:30)(u) (cid:0) (cid:30)(v)j; v 2 U , we have our upper bound.

Now we lower bound the point-to-subset distanes. Consider again a parti-

ular point u and subset U = fu

For any oordinate orresponding to a subset S generated using R = r, we show

First we ondition on some point within r=32 of u

a onstant probability of the (cid:21)

u adding up to at least 2=3 (over hoie of `). Condition on this as well. Then

Sine this happens for all oordinates with R = r, i.e. N of the oordinates,

the statement true with high probability for every point, every subset, and every

onvex ombination simultaneously.

is the ase that an embedding realizing this distortion of the optimal solution
