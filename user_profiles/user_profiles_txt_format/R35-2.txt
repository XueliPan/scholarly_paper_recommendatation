Abstract.  Web  search  personalization  aims  to  adapt  search  results  to  a  user 
based  on  his  tastes,  interests  and  needs.  The  way  in  which  such  personal 
preferences  are  captured,  modeled  and  exploited  distinguishes  the  different 
personalization strategies. In this paper, we propose to represent a user profile 
in  terms  of  social  tags,  manually  provided by  users  in  folksonomy  systems  to 
describe, categorize and organize items of interest, and investigate a number of 
novel  techniques  that  exploit  the  users‟  social  tags  to  re-rank  results  obtained 
with  a  Web  search  engine.  An  evaluation  conducted  with  a  dataset  from 
Delicious social bookmarking system shows that our personalization techniques 
clearly outperform state of the art approaches.

Introduction 

The huge and ever increasing volume and complexity of information available in 
the  Web  constitutes  a  difficult  challenge  for  content  retrieval  technologies.  In  a 
traditional  Web  search  system,  such  as  Google1  or  Yahoo!2,  a  user  expresses  his 
information  needs  by  providing  a  textual  query  consisted  in  a  limited  number  of 
keywords.  The  search  system  takes  as  input  this  query,  and  attempts  to  retrieve  the 
Web documents that best match its keywords. Queries are usually short – containing 
no more than 3 keywords on 85% of the times – and ambiguous [7], and often fail to 
reflect  the  user‟s  needs.  Nonetheless,  although  the  information  contained  in  these 
keywords  rarely  suffices  for  the  exact  determination  of  the  user‟s  wishes,  this 
approach represents a simple way of interaction users are accustomed to. There is thus 
a need to investigate ways to enhance information retrieval, without altering the way the 
users  specify  their  requests.  It  is  in  such  scenario  where  personalized  information 
retrieval techniques can help the users, by tailoring the search results based on both the 
users‟ short and long term preferences [4]. However, to achieve that goal, information 
about the users‟ tastes and interests has to be found in other sources. 

With  the  advent  of  the  Web  2.0,  social  tagging  systems  have  been  exponentially 
grown both in terms of users and contents. These systems allow the users to provide 
annotations  (tags)  to  resources,  expressing  personal  descriptions  and  opinions  about

the  resources  for  organizational  and  sharing  purposes.  For  instance,  in  Last.fm3,  the 
users annotate their favorite songs; in Flickr4, the users store and annotate their own 
photo  streams;  and  in  Delicious5,  the  users  bookmark  and  annotate  interesting  Web 
pages.  Apart  from  facilitating  the  organization  and  sharing  of  content,  these  „social 
tagging‟  data,  also  known  as  folksonomies,  can  be  considered  as  a  fairly  accurate 
source  of  user  interests.  Several  studies  have  proven  that  a  user  profile  can  be 
effectively  harvested  from  these  systems  [1,  11],  and  later  exploited  on  different 
personalization services, such as tag recommendation [3], item recommendation [10], 
and personalized search [6, 10, 13], to name a few. 

In  this  work,  we  present  two  novel  personalization  techniques  that  exploit  a  user 
profile defined within a social tagging system to re-rank the document lists retrieved 
by  a  traditional  Web  search  engine.  In  particular,  we  investigate  whether  a 
folksonomy-based  user  profile  defined  in  Delicious  social  bookmarking  system  can 
really  enhance  the  results  provided  by  Yahoo!  Search  engine.  To  evaluate  such 
techniques,  we  propose  an  automatic  mechanism  that  generates  test  datasets  from 
social  tagging  corpora.  The  results  obtained  in  our  experiments  show  that  our 
personalization techniques clearly outperform state of the art approaches. 

The rest of the paper has the following structure. In Section  2, we describe works 
that are related to our research. In Section 3, we present the state of the art and own 
personalization  approaches  we  evaluate  and  compare.  In  Section  4,  we  propose  an 
evaluation framework and an experimental methodology for folksonomy-based Web 
search  personalization  techniques.  We  present  the  evaluation  results  in  Section  5. 
Finally, in Section 6, we provide some conclusions and possible future work lines. 

2  Related Work 

Personalized  retrieval  models  that  exploit  user  profiles  based  on  social  tags  have 

been investigated in previous works. 

Shepitsen  et  al.  [10]  present  a  strategy  that  clusters  the  entire  space  of  tags  to 
obtain  sets  of  (semantically)  related  tags.  Representing  coherent  topic  areas,  the 
obtained clusters are used to provide personalized item recommendations. Rather than 
item  recommendation,  the  techniques  presented  in  this  paper  follow  personalized 
retrieval models applicable to Web search, where lists of search results are re-ranked 
according to the user‟s preferences. 

Hotho  et  al.  propose  the  FolkRank  algorithm  [4],  an  adaptation  of  the  PageRank 
algorithm  to  the  folksonomy  structure.  FolkRank  performs  a  weight-spreading 
ranking  scheme  on  folksonomies.  It  transforms  the  hypergraph  between  the  sets  of 
users, tags and resources into an undirected, weighted, tripartite graph. On this graph, 
it  applies  a  version  of  PageRank  that  takes  into  account  the  obtained  edge  weights. 
Among  other  applications,  FolkRank  provides  a  popularity  measure  of  a  document 
that seems to be better than PageRank, as it exploits the user generated folksonomy,

rather  than  the  Web  links.  Bao  et  al.  [2]  also  investigate  the  use  of  popularity 
measures  derived  from  the  folksonomy  structure,  but  focusing  its  application  in  a 
Web search system. They introduce two importance score values, SocialSimRank and 
SocialPageRank,  which  measure  the  relevance  of  a  document  to  a  query,  and  the 
popularity of a document, respectively. They conclude that these measures provide a 
better performance than traditional  measures,  such as term  matching and PageRank. 
Similar  to  the  studies  of  Hotho  et  al.  and  Bao  et  al.,  we  exploit  the  folksonomy 
structure,  but  focus  on  offering  a  personalized  search  to  the  user,  rather  than 
improving the overall rank of documents. 

Noll  and  Meinel  [6]  present  a  personalization  model  that  exploits  the  user‟s  and 
documents‟ related tags, improving a Web search system during their user evaluation. 
Xu et al. [13] also present a user-document similarity function that relates the user‟s 
and  documents‟  tags,  and  enrich  the  user‟s  profile  representation  following  a  tag 
expansion  strategy,  which  is  applied  over  a  restricted  corpus.  Our  personalization 
approaches  follow  the  same  personalization  model  as  Xu  et  al.‟s  and  Null  and 
Meinel‟s, but utilize different techniques to calculate the user-document similarities. 
We  shall  evaluate  and  compare  our  proposals  against  the  approaches  presented  by 
these authors. 

3  Web Search Personalization based on Folksonomies 

A  folksonomy  F  can  be  defined  as  a  tuple  F =  T, U, D, A ,  where  T =
 𝑡1, … , 𝑡𝐿   is  the  set  of  tags  that  comprise  the  vocabulary  expressed  by  the 
folksonomy,  U =  𝑢1, … , 𝑢𝑀  and D =  𝑑1, … , 𝑑𝑁  are respectively the set of users 
and  the  set  of  documents6  that  annotate  and  are  annotated  with  the  tags  of  T,  and 
A =   𝑢𝑚 , 𝑡𝑙, 𝑑𝑛    ∈ U × T × D is the set of assignments (annotations) of each tag 
𝑡𝑙 to a document 𝑑𝑛  by a user 𝑢𝑚 . 

The  profile  of  user  𝑢𝑚   is  then  defined  as  a  vector  𝑢𝑚       =  𝑢𝑚 ,1, … , 𝑢𝑚 ,𝐿 ,  where 
𝑢𝑚 ,𝑙 =    um,, tl, d   ∈ A|𝑑 ∈ D    is  the  number  of  times  the  user  has  annotated 
documents  with  tag  𝑡𝑙.  Similarly,  the  profile  of  document  𝑑𝑛   is  defined  as  a  vector 
      =  𝑑𝑛,1, … , 𝑑𝑛 ,𝐿 , where 𝑑𝑛,𝑙 =    𝑢, 𝑡𝑙, 𝑑𝑛    ∈ A|𝑢 ∈ U   is the number of times 
𝑑𝑛
the document has been annotated with tag  𝑡𝑙. In our Web search scenario, the  set of 
documents  D  represents  the  resources  present  in  the  Web,  and  are  identified  by  an 
URL. Users are identified by a user id. 

In this work, we exploit folksonomy-based user and document profiles in order to 
personalize  the  results  of  a  Web  search  system.  A  non-personalized  Web  search 
system  S  provides  a  ranked  list  of  documents  S 𝑞  ⊆ D  that  satisfy  a  given  query 
topic 𝑞. The ranking follows an ordering τ = [𝑑1 ≥ 𝑑2 ≥ ⋯ ≥ 𝑑𝑘 ], in which 𝑑𝑖 ∈ D 
and  ≥  is  the  ordering  relation  implemented  by  the  search  system.  Upon  this  ranked 
document list,  we define a personalization approach  S' that provides a ranked list of 
documents  S' 𝑞, 𝑢  ⊆ D by reordering the results  S 𝑞  according to the  preferences 
                                                           
6   In more general definitions of folksonomy, annotated items, which are not necessarily textual, 
are  usually  called  “resources”.  As  we  deal  with  the  exploitation of  folksonomies  in  a  Web 
Search scenario, we instead use the term (Web) “documents” to reference resources.

of user 𝑢. More formally, it provides an ordering τ′ = [𝑑1 ≥ 𝑑2 ≥ ⋯ ≥ 𝑑𝑘 ] such that 
the  ordering  relation  is  defined  by  𝑑𝑖 ≥ 𝑑𝑗 ⟺ sim 𝑢, 𝑑𝑖, 𝑞  ≥ sim 𝑢, 𝑑𝑗 , 𝑞 ,  where 
sim 𝑢, 𝑑, 𝑞   is  a  similarity  function  between  user  𝑢  and  document  𝑑,  taking  into 
consideration the ranking of 𝑑 in S 𝑞 . 

The  subsequent  subsections  present  the  different  personalization  techniques  we 
propose and evaluate. The first two techniques are obtained from the state of the art, 
and are based on the Vector Space Model (VSM). The third technique  is a personal 
adaptation  of  the  VSM  to  social  tagging  profiles.  The  last  technique  is  a  novel 
personalization approach that follows a probabilistic model. More specifically, it is an 
adaptation of the Okapi BM25 ranking model.  

For  a  better  understanding,  Table  1  gathers  the  definition  of  common  elements 
appearing in the models of the above techniques. It is worth noting that whereas in the 
classic  VSM  the  document  collection  is  the  only  source  for  the  calculation  of  term 
frequencies and inverse document  frequencies,  in a  folksonomy-based  framework,  we 
can also consider how informative the tags (terms) are in the user set.  Thus, the user-
based  tag  frequency  𝑡𝑓𝑢𝑚
 𝑡𝑙   measures  how  relevant  a  tag  𝑡𝑙  is  to  a  user  𝑢𝑚 ,  and  the 
user-based tag inverse frequency  𝑖𝑢𝑓 𝑡𝑙  measures how common or popular a tag  𝑡𝑙 is 
across  all  users  U. The  presented  approaches  can  also  be  differentiated  by  how  these 
local and global importance values are exploited.

3.1  Cosine Similarity based Personalization 

The approach presented by Xu et al. [13] uses the classic cosine similarity measure 
to compute the similarity between user and document profiles. As weighting scheme, 
it uses 𝑡𝑓-𝑖𝑑𝑓7. Following our notation, their approach can be defined as follows: 

cos𝑡𝑓 -𝑖𝑑𝑓  𝑢𝑚 , 𝑑𝑛   =

   𝑡𝑓𝑢𝑚

 𝑡𝑙  ⋅ 𝑖𝑢𝑓 𝑡𝑙  ⋅ 𝑡𝑓𝑑𝑛

7   Xu  et  al.  do  not  specify  if  they  use  the  user-based  or  the  document-based  inverse  tag 

frequency weights, or both. We chose to use both, as it gave the best performance values.

where the numerator is the dot product of the 𝑡𝑓-𝑖𝑢𝑓 and 𝑡𝑓-𝑖𝑑𝑓 vectors associated to 
the  user and the document,  respectively. The denominator is the user and document 
length normalization factors, calculated as the magnitude value of those vectors. Xu et 
al. use a weighting scheme based on the BM25 model, this variation will henceforth 
denoted as cos𝑏𝑚 25 𝑢𝑚 , 𝑑𝑛  . See Section 3.4 for more details on this approach. 

3.2 

Scalar Tag Frequency based Personalization  

The  approach  presented  by  Noll  and  Meinel  [6]  is  similar  to  the  cosine-based 
approach,  but  does  not  make  use  of  the  user  and  document  length  normalization 
factors,  and  only  uses  the  user  tag  frequency  values.  The  authors  normalize  all 
document tag  frequencies to  1, since they  want to give  more importance to the  user 
profile  when  computing  the  similarity  measures.  Following  the  notation  given  in 
Table 1, their similarity measure can be defined as follows: 

𝑡𝑓 𝑢𝑚 , 𝑑𝑛   =  

l:𝑑𝑛 ,𝑙>0

𝑡𝑓𝑢𝑚  𝑡𝑙 

 . 

3.3 

Scalar 𝒕𝒇-𝒊𝒇 based Personalization 

Next, we present our first proposed personalization approach. Similarly to Xu et al. 
[13],  we  use  the  𝑡𝑓-𝑖𝑑𝑓  weighting  scheme.  We  eliminate  however  the  user  and 
document length normalization factors. In the classic VSM, the finality  of the length 
normalization factor is to penalize the score of documents that contain a high amount 
of information, and might have matched the query only by chance. In terms of a social 
tagging system, a high amount of related tags is correlated with the popularity of the 
documents among users. Hence, if we used a length normalization factor, we would 
penalize the score of popular documents. As several works point out, this popularity 
value is a good source of relevancy [2, 4]. Thus, it would not be advisable to penalize 
popular  documents.  Note  that  eliminating  the  user  length  normalization  factor  does 
not have any effect, as it is constant in all user-document similarity calculations. 

The  main  difference  between  our  approach  and  Noll  and  Meinel‟s  [6]  is  that  we 
incorporate both the user and document tag distribution global importance factors, i.e. 
𝑖𝑢𝑓  and  𝑖𝑑𝑓,  following  the  VSM  principle  that  as  more  rare  a  tag  is,  the  more 
important it is when describing either a user‟s interests or a document‟s content. We 
do not normalize the content of the documents, as we believe  that the distribution of 
tags  on  a  document  may  give  insights  on  how  important  a  tag  is  to  describe  its 
content. This personalization approach can thus be defined as following: 

𝑡𝑓-𝑖𝑓 𝑢𝑚 , 𝑑𝑛   =    𝑡𝑓𝑢𝑚  𝑡𝑙  ⋅ 𝑖𝑢𝑓 𝑡𝑙  ⋅ 𝑡𝑓𝑑𝑛  𝑡𝑙  ⋅ 𝑖𝑑𝑓 𝑡𝑙   
.

 BM25 based Personalization 

The  novel  personalization  approach  presented  in  this  section  differs  from  the 
previously  presented  ones  in  that  it  follows  a  probabilistic  model,  rather  than  the 
classic  VSM.  We  adapt  the  Okapi  BM25  ranking  model  [9]  to  a  personalization 
ranking of similarity between a user and a document.  The  BM25 model computes a 
ranking score function of a document given a query. We can then adapt this model in 

6 

David Vallet1, Ivan Cantador1, Joemon M. Jose1 

two  different  ways:  1)  by  assuming  that  the  user  profile  takes  part  as  a  query 
indicating  the  user‟s  interests,  or  2)  by  assuming  that  the  document  takes  part  as  a 
query, and is matched against all user profiles. The former option will be henceforth 
denoted  as  𝑏𝑚25𝑢𝑚   and  the  latter  as  𝑏𝑚25𝑑𝑛 .  We  first  define  both  score  functions 
for a single tag 𝑡𝑙: 

   𝑏𝑚25𝑢𝑚  𝑡𝑙  = 𝑖𝑢𝑓 𝑡𝑙  ∙  

𝑏𝑚25𝑑𝑛  𝑡𝑙  = 𝑖𝑑𝑓 𝑡𝑙  ∙

𝑎𝑣𝑔   𝑑𝑛   

where 𝑏  and  𝑘1  are  set  to  the  standard  values  of  0.75  and  2, respectively.  Then,  we 
define the two variations of this personalization approach: 

    𝑏𝑚25𝑢𝑚  𝑑𝑛 , 𝑢𝑚   =  
𝑏𝑚25𝑑𝑛  𝑑𝑛 , 𝑢𝑚   =  

 𝑙|𝑑𝑛 ,𝑙>0 

 𝑙 𝑢𝑚 ,𝑙 >0 

, 

𝑏𝑚25𝑢𝑚  𝑡𝑙 
𝑏𝑚25𝑑𝑛  𝑡𝑙 
 . 

Xu et al. [12] compute a  VSM  based cosine  similarity  measure  with a  weighting 
scheme inspired by the BM25 retrieval model. Following the notation of this section, 
this measure can be defined as follows: 

cos𝑏𝑚 25 𝑑𝑛 , 𝑢𝑚   =

Evaluating Folksonomy-based Personalization Approaches 

Noll  and  Meinel  [6]  evaluated  their  personalization  approach  combined  with  a 
Web  search  engine.  They  adopted  a  user  centered  evaluation  by  creating  a  set  of 
predefined  queries,  and  by  asking  users  to  evaluate  the  results.  More  specifically, 
users  were  asked  to  evaluate  which  result  list  they  preferred:  either  the  Web  search 
ranking  or  the  personalized  ranking.  Xu  et  al.  [13]  used  the  social  bookmarking 
information  to  create  an  automatic  evaluation  framework.  The  main  advantage  of 
their framework is that the experiments could be reproduced. However, they did not 
explore  the  performance  of  their  personalization  approaches  when  combined  with  a 
Web  search  engine.  They  combined  their  approach  with  a  search  system  that  was 
limited  to  the  bookmarks  pertinent  to  their  test  beds,  ranging  from  1K  to  15K  Web 
documents.  The  goal  of  our  evaluation  framework  falls  in  the  middle  of  these  two 
approaches:  1)  as  Noll  and  Meinel,  we  are  more  interested  in  testing  our 
personalization approach in a real Web search environment; and 2) as Xu et al.,  we 
adopt  an  automatic  evaluation  framework  with  a  test  bed  of  topics  and  relevance 
judgments  extracted  from  the  social  bookmarking  information.  In  this  section,  we 
describe our evaluation framework, highlighting the main differences between it and 
the previously presented.

4.1  Topic and Relevance Judgment generation 

We split the tagging information of a given user into two parts. The first part forms 
the  user  profiling  information,  whereas  the  second  is  used  for  the  automatic  topic 
generation process. Hence, the subset of tag assignments used in the topic generation 
process is not included in the user profile, constitutes our test dataset, and thus is not 
part of our training dataset. This splitting process is applied to all users belonging to 
the initial test bed collection. Figure 1 outlines how the partition is made.  

  

Fig. 1. Partitioning of user tag assignments into user profile and information intended for topic 
generation 

As  shown  in  the  figure,  the  topic  creation  process  attempts  to  create  a  new  topic 
from  each  document  𝑑 ∈ [𝑑𝑛+1, … , 𝑑𝑡]  belonging  to  the  test  split  part.  A  topic  is 
defined by extracting the top most popular tags related to  a document 𝑑. We use the 
most popular tags as they are more objective to describe the document contents than 
those assigned by a single or few users. These tags are used to launch a Web search, 
and we collect the retrieved result list. 

We  then  study  how  the  different  personalization  approaches  re-rank  the  returned 
result list. As document 𝑑 was contained in the original user profile, we can assume 
that  the  document  is  relevant  to  the  user.  Thus,  a  good  personalization  approach 
would always rank the document in the top positions of the result list. 

We use the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) [12] metric to measure the performance 
of the personalization techniques. This measure assigns a value of performance for a 
topic of 1/𝑟, where 𝑟 is the position of the relevant 𝑑 in the final personalized result 
list. We also provide the P@N (Precision at position N) metric, which has a value of 1 
iff 𝑟 ≤ N. These values are averaged over all the generated topics. 

The  topic  generation  and  evaluation  can  be  summarized  in  the  following 
methodology.  For  each  document  𝑑 ∈ [𝑑𝑛+1, … , 𝑑𝑡]:  1)  we  generate  a  topic 
description  using  the  top  k  most  popular  tags  associated  to  the  document;  2)  we 
execute  the  topic  on  a  Web  search  system  and  return  the  top  𝑅  documents  as  the 
topic‟s result list; 3) if document 𝑑 is not found in the result list, we discard the topic 
for evaluation; 4)  we apply the different personalization  techniques to the result set; 
and 5) we compute MRR and P@N values. 

In  our  experiments,  we  used  a  query  size  of  𝑘 = 3  tags,  and  a  result  list  size  of 
𝑅 = 300  documents.  Several  studies  point  out  an  average  user  query  size  of  2-3 
keywords in Web search [7]. We thus opted for a query size of 3 in order to emulate a 
user  using  a  Web  search  system,  and  to  evaluate  if  user  profiles  obtained  from  the 
social tagging actions of the users could be successfully exploited to improve a Web 
search system. We also investigated the  generation of query topics with 2 keywords 

Userud1al,n={u, tl, dn}∊Aa1,1a2,1al,1…dna1,na2,nal,n……dta1,ta2,tal,t……UserprofileTopicgeneration8

obtaining  performance  results  similar  to  those  obtained  with  topic  sizes  of  3 
keywords. There is of course a chance that document  𝑑 does not appear in the result 
list. In this case, the document is discarded for topic generation. With these settings, 
24.2%  of  the  topics  were  successfully  generated,  and  the  average  position  of 
document 𝑑 on the result list was 62.2. 

As  mentioned  before,  Xu  et  al.  also  presented  an  automatic  topic  generation 
methodology  based  on  the  users‟  tagging  data.  However,  there  are  some  key 
differences  between  their  evaluation  framework  and  ours.  First,  they  applied  the 
personalization  techniques  to  a  custom  search  engine  that  only  retrieves  documents 
that belong to the same test bed. Our methodology, on the other hand, makes use of 
Web  search  system  to  return  the  topic  document.  In  this  way,  we  intend  to  have  a 
more realistic set up. Second, they used each tag of the user profiles as a query topic, 
thus resulting on queries  with a single  keyword. This resulted on too broad queries, 
which are not  suitable for a free Web search system. We rather choose  to  use  more 
specific queries of  three  keywords,  which are  generated based on the  social tagging 
information  associated  to  a  document  that  was  originally  in  the  user  profile.  Third, 
their  approach  assumed  that  a  returned  document  was  relevant  to  the  user  if  it  was 
tagged by him with the same tag that belonged to the topic query. Our ground truth is 
more restrictive, as we only consider as relevant the document that generated the topic 
query.  By  doing  this  we  can  ensure  that  the  document  is  relevant  to  both  the  topic 
query, as the query keywords represent the people‟s view of the document‟s content, 
and  to  the  user,  as  the  document  belongs  to  the  user‟s  profile.  In  summary,  we 
consider 
folksonomy-based 
personalization  of  a  Web  search  system.  Nonetheless,  we  do  believe  that  both 
approaches  may  complement  each  other  in  order  to  give  more  insights  on  the 
performance of personalization strategies.

4.2  Experimental Setup 

We  created  a  test  bed  formed  by  2,000  Delicious  users.  Delicious  is  a  social 
bookmarking site for Web pages. As of the 26th of November of 2008, delicious had 
5.3 million  users9, up from 1  million  users registered  on September of 200610. With 
over  180  million  unique  URLs,  Delicious  can  be  considered  a  fairly  accurate 
“people‟s  view”  of  the  Web.  This  vast  amount  of  user  information  has  been 
previously  successfully  exploited  to  improve  Web  search  [2],  to  provide  personal 
recommendations [4, 10], and to personalize search results [6, 13], among others. 

Due to limitations of Delicious API, we only extracted the latest 100 bookmarks of 
each user, from  which  we use 90% of the  bookmarks to create the user profile, and 
the remaining 10% to generate the evaluation topics as described in Section 4.1. The 
test bed contained 161,542 documents and 69,930 distinct tags. We did not apply any 
pre-processing  steps  to  the  user  tags.  Users  used  an  average  of  5.6  tags  to  describe 
each  bookmark.  As  experimental  Web  search  system,  we  use  Yahoo!‟s  open  Web

search platform, Yahoo! Boss11. After the topic generation process, we ended up with 
6,109 evaluation topics. For each document in the topic result set, we downloaded the 
100  most  recent  bookmarks.  Those  documents  had  an  average  of  24.3  distinct 
associated  tags.  On  average,  20.13%  of  the  documents  of  the  result  list  had  been 
bookmarked at least once by a user.

Experiment Results 

We  present  the  results  of  the  proposed  personalization  techniques  within  the 
evaluation framework explained in Section 4. We first provide the performance of the 
approaches when applied in isolation to the search results returned by the Web search 
system.  Then,  we  show  their  performance  when  taking  into  consideration  the  result 
ranking provided by the Web search system. 

5.1  Results of Personalization Approaches 

In this section, we analyze the performance of the personalization approaches when 
only  the  personalization  scores  are  used  to  reorder  the  results  returned  by  the  Web 
search  system,  i.e.,  when  the  ranking  given  by  the  search  system  is  not  taken  into 
account. Table 2 shows Mean Reciprocal Ranking (MRR) and Precision (at 5, at 10, 
at 20) values of the personalization approaches.

statistically significant higher value than the 𝑡𝑓 approach (Wilcoxon test, p < 0.05). Values in 
bold  indicate  the  highest  values  with  statistical  significance.  The  column  𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑏  refers  to  the 
rank-based combination of 𝑏𝑚25𝑢𝑚and 𝑡𝑓-𝑖𝑓 approaches

The  cosine  similarity  approaches  presented  by  Xu  et  al.  [13],  cos𝑡𝑓 -𝑖𝑑𝑓   and 
cosbm 25, have much lower performance values than the rest of the approaches, even 
though Xu et al. report for them a performance better than the 𝑡𝑓 approach, presented 
by  Noll  and  Meinel  [6].  A  possible  reason  for  this  contradiction  is  the  difference 
between Xu et al.‟s and our evaluation setups. On one hand, the length normalization 
factor  used  in  the  cosine  similarity  function  penalizes  those  documents  with  a  high 
amount  of  assigned  tags,  i.e.,  those  documents  that  are  more  popular,  in  favor  of 
documents that have fewer related tags. This penalization factor may be self-defeating 
according  to  different  studies  [2,  4]  which  suggest  that  a  popular  document  has  a 
higher chance to be relevant to a user. We noticed that the documents returned by the 
Web  search  system  were  highly  diverse  in  terms  of  popularity,  and  thus  the

discrimination  of  popular  documents  had  a  sensible  negative  impact.  On  the  other 
hand,  Xu  et  al.  make  use  of  a  controlled  document  collection,  no  larger  than  15K 
documents, which may not have these characteristics. 

The   𝑏𝑚25𝑢𝑚  approach obtains a performance statistically significant higher than 
the 𝑏𝑚25𝑑𝑛  approach. This implies that, in a folksonomy model, it is better to assume 
that  the  user  acts  as  a  document  in  terms  of  the  probabilistic  model‟s  relevance 
computation.  Compared  to  the  other  personalization  approaches,  the  𝑏𝑚25𝑢𝑚 
approach has a better performance in terms of the MRR metric, outperforming the  𝑡𝑓 
approach,  which  is  the  best  found  in  the  state  of  the  art.  However,  it  has  a 
performance statistically significant lower than the 𝑡𝑓-𝑖𝑓 approach.  

The  performance  of  𝑡𝑓-𝑖𝑓  approach  is  higher  than  both  the  𝑖𝑓  and  the  𝑏𝑚25 
approaches,  with  statistical  significant  differences  on  all  the  used  metrics.  These 
results highlight the importance of incorporating the global frequencies calculated for 
a  given  tag,  i.e.,  the  tag  user  inverse  frequency  𝑖𝑢𝑓  and  the  tag  document  inverse 
frequency 𝑖𝑑𝑓. 

Moreover,  since  the  𝑏𝑚25𝑢𝑚  and  the  𝑡𝑓-𝑖𝑓  approaches  are  based  on  different 
models, the probabilistic and the vector space models, respectively, we investigate the 
performance  of  a  combination  of  both  approaches.  We  use  a  simple,  well  known, 
parameter  free  rank  based  aggregation  strategy,  CombSUM  [8],  to  merge  their 
rankings. The obtained performance results are presented in the last column of Table 
2, and are encouraging: this strategy is the highest performing approach, achieving a 
13.91%  improvement  on  MRR,  and  a  8.12%  improvement  in  terms  of    P@5,  with 
respect  to  the  best performing  state  of  the  art  approach,  𝑡𝑓, indicating  that  both  our 
approaches  complement  each  other.  The  combination  of  the  𝑏𝑚25𝑢𝑚and  the  𝑡𝑓 
approach  also  resulted  in  a  performance  improvement,  but  lower  than  the  former 
combination.  Of  course,  combining  𝑡𝑓-𝑖𝑓  and  𝑡𝑓  approaches  did  not  result  on  a 
performance improvement. 

5.2  Results of Folksonomy-based Personalized Web Search 

We now investigate the performance of the personalization approaches when used 
in  combination  with  a  Web  search  system.  In  order  to  do  this,  we  merge  the  result 
lists returned by the Web search system (denoted as S 𝑞  in Section 3) with the result 
lists  produced  by  the  personalization  approaches,  i.e.,  the  results  evaluated  in  the 
previous section. 

Table 3. Personalization approaches performance when combined with the Web search engine 
results.  Values  with  an  asterisk  indicate  a  statistically  significant  higher  value  than  the  Web 
search  ranking  (Wilcoxon  test,  p  <  0.05). Values  marked  with  a  †  also  indicate  a  statistically 
significant higher value than the 𝑡𝑓 approach. Values in bold are the highest significant values

As  a  baseline,  we  use  the  Web  search  system.  In  order  to  make  a  more  fair 
comparison,  we  eliminate  from  its  result  lists  those  documents  that  were  not 
bookmarked  by  any  user.  The  final  ranked  lists  are  combinations  of  both  the  non-
personalized  and  the  personalized  rank  lists  using  the  CombSUM  rank  based 
aggregation method [8]. Table 3 shows the performance values of the personalization 
approaches  combined  with  the  Web  search.  Values  are  correlated  with  those 
presented in Table 2. 

The  cosine  similarity  personalization  approaches  degrade  the  performance  of  the 
Web  search,  while  the  rest  of  approaches  outperform  the  baseline.  The  two 
approaches proposed in this  work,  𝑡𝑓-𝑖𝑓 and  𝑏𝑚25𝑢𝑚 , perform better than both the 
baseline  and  𝑡𝑓.  Again,  the  combination  of  𝑡𝑓  and  𝑏𝑚25𝑢𝑚   personalization 
approaches yield the best performance, both in terms of MRR and precision. This 
demonstrates  the  complementarity  of  both  approaches,  whose  combination 
achieves  23.72%  and  4.3%  improvements  with  respect  to  the  baseline  and  𝑡𝑓 
approaches, respectively.

Conclusions and Future Work 

In this paper, we have presented two novel techniques that exploit user and document 
profiles defined in a social tagging system to personalize the result rankings of a Web 
search  system.  The  first  personalization  approach  is  based  on  the  vector  space 
information  retrieval  model,  and  incorporates  the  concepts  of  tag  inverse  document 
frequency and tag inverse user frequency, which are global measures that rely on the 
tag distribution within the folksonomy-based user and document profiles. The second 
personalization  approach  is  an  adaptation  of  the  BM25  probabilistic  model  to 
folksonomy systems based on the above user and document representations. 

We  have  also  proposed  a  novel  evaluation  framework  and  a  topic  generation 
methodology which allow the automatic evaluation of folksonomy-based Web search 
personalization approaches. The results obtained with the evaluations conducted over 
a  dataset  from  Delicious  social  bookmarking  system  show  that  our  techniques 
outperform  the  state  of  the  art  folksonomy-based  personalization  approaches. 
Furthermore,  we  demonstrate  how  our 
techniques  can 
complement each other, achieving the best overall performance when combined by a 
well-known rang aggregation strategy. We claim that the key points of the achieved 
performances are 1) the use  of the  proposed global tag importance  measures, 2) the 
removal  of  length  normalization  factors  in  personalization  formulas,  and  3)  the 
adaptation of the probabilistic model. 

two  personalization 

The  presented  techniques  can  be  applied  to  any  Web  search  system,  providing 
personalization capabilities to any user who has a profile in a social tagging service. 
Thus, with no extra effort, a user can personalize and enhance the results provided by 
a certain Web search engine. In our evaluations, we obtained a performance increase 
of  23.7%  over  Yahoo!  Search,  demonstrating  the  feasibility  of  this  personalization 
paradigm.

The  approaches  evaluated  in  this  paper  exploit  the  folksonomy‟s  user,  tag  and 
document distribution. However, there are also specific techniques which exploit the 
folksonomy  structure  in  order  to  expand  the  folksonomy-based  profiles.  The  main 
problem is that, to date, these techniques are not easily scalable to the Web, and have 
to  be  evaluated  in  small  controlled  collections  [13].  Thus,  we  were  unable  to 
incorporate  them  into  our  Web  search  personalization  framework.  In  the  future,  we 
will  investigate  a  scalable  expansion  strategy  that  could  allow  its  application  to 
personalization approaches focused on Web search.  

We  will  also  study  how  our  personalization  techniques  can  be  combined  with 
folksonomy-based  popularity  measures  presented  in  the  state  of  the  art  [2,  4]. 
Although our techniques include some basic document popularity factors, they could 
be complemented by the above more complex measures.
