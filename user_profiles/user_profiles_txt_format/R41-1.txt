ABSTRACT
“One Click Fraud” is an online conﬁdence scam that has been
plaguing an increasing number of Japanese Internet users, in spite
of new laws and the mobilization of police task forces. In this scam,
the victim clicks on a link presented to them, only to be informed
that they just entered a binding contract and are required to pay
a registration fee for a service. Even though no money is legally
owed, a large number of users prefer to pay up, because of po-
tential embarrassment due to the type of service “requested” (e.g.,
pornographic goods).

Using public reports of fraudulent websites as a source of data,
we analyze over 2,000 reported One Click Frauds incidents. By
correlating several attributes (WHOIS data, bank accounts, phone
numbers, malware installed...), we discover that a few fraudsters
are seemingly responsible for a majority of the scams, and evidence
a number of loopholes these miscreants exploit. We further show
that, while some of these sites may also be engaging in other il-
licit activities such as spamming, the connection between different
types of scams is not as obvious as we initially expected. Last, we
show that the rise in the number of these frauds is fueled by high
expected monetary gains in return for very little risk. The quantita-
tive data obtained gives us an interesting window on the economic
dynamics of some online criminal syndicates.

INTRODUCTION

In the family apartment in Tokyo, Ken is sitting at his computer,
casually browsing the free section of a mildly erotic website. Sud-
denly, a window pops up, telling him,

Thank you for your patronage! You successfully reg-
istered for our premium online services, at an incred-
ible price of 50,000 JPY.1 Please promptly send your
payment by bank transfer to ABC Ltd at Ginko Bank,
Account 1234567. Questions? Please contact us at
080-1234-1234.

Your IP address is 10.1.2.3, you run Firefox 3.5 over
Windows XP, and you are connecting from Tokyo.

Failure to send your payment promptly will force us
to mail you a postcard reminder to your home address.
Customers refusing to pay will be prosecuted to the
fullest extent of the law.

Once again, thank you for your patronage!

A sample postcard reminder is shown on the screen, and consists
of a scantily clad woman in a provocative pose. Ken has a sud-
den panic attack: He is married, and, if his wife were to ﬁnd out
about his browsing habits, his marriage would be in trouble, pos-
sibly ending in divorce, and public shame. In his frenzied state of
mind, Ken also fears that, if anybody at his company heard about
this, he could lose his job. Obviously, those website operators know
who he is and where he lives, and could make his life very difﬁcult.
Now, 50,000 JPY (≈ USD 500) seems like a small price to pay to
make all of this go away. Ken immediately jots down the contact
information, goes to the nearest bank, and acquits himself of his
supposed debt.

Ken has just been the victim of a relatively common online scam
perpetrated in Japan, called “One Click Fraud.” In this fraud, the
“customer,” i.e., the victim, does not enter any legally binding agree-
ment, and the perpetrators only have marginal information about
the client that connected to their website (IP address, User-Agent
string), which does not reveal much about the user.2 However, fac-
ing a display of authority stressed by the language used, includ-
ing the notion that they are monitored, and a sense of shame from
browsing sites with questionable contents, most victims do not re-
alize they are part of an extortion scam. Some victims even call
up the phone numbers provided in hopes of resolving the situation,

1Over the past ﬁve years, on average, 100 JPY≈ 1 USD.
2The Panopticlick project [11] aims to show that browser ﬁnger-
prints can divulge considerable information about the user. How-
ever, none of the One Click Fraud websites we investigated appears
to use any advanced browser ﬁngerprinting techniques.

15and disclose private information, such as name or address, to their
tormentors, which makes them even more vulnerable to blackmail.
As a result, One Click Frauds have been very successful in Japan.
Annual police reports show that the estimated amount of mone-
tary damages stemming from One Click Frauds and related con-
ﬁdence scams are roughly 26 billion JPY per year (i.e., USD 260
million/year). The rapid rise of such frauds has led to new laws be-
ing passed [18, 20], to the deployment of police task forces specif-
ically put in charge of solving these frauds, and to specialized help
desks [16]. In addition, there have been so far, on average 657 ar-
rests and 2,859 solved cases per year [15]. Considering the lack of
technical sophistication needed to set up such extortion schemes,
and the fact that bank accounts and phone numbers can be made
very hard to trace in Japan (discussed in Section 5), it appears that
One Click Frauds offer easy money to aspiring criminals.

From a research point of view, One Click Frauds offer a unique
opportunity for a case study in online crime economics. First, One
Click Frauds, are extremely localized. We have not seen any in-
stance of this speciﬁc fraud outside of Japan, presumably due to the
fact that the scammers prey on unique Japanese cultural character-
istics, such as respect of authority, or embarrassment at the idea of
causing trouble. Rather than limiting our research, we view this lo-
cal aspect as an opportunity. Indeed, because One Click Frauds are
contained to Japan, and are almost exclusively used in Japanese-
language websites, we can obtain a relatively exhaustive view of
how these frauds are deployed and the characteristics they share,
without the need for a complex measurement infrastructure. Fur-
thermore, One Click Frauds, albeit unique, are very closely related
to the body of scareware scams (e.g., windows popping up trying
to entice users to buy fake anti-virus software) that are becoming
increasingly pervasive, and we believe One Click Frauds offer an
interesting insights into this type of criminal enterprise.

The ﬁrst contribution of this paper is to collect and analyze a
corpus of over 2,000 reported One Click Fraud incidents, and to use
the data collected to paint a relatively clear picture of the economic
dynamics of an instance of online criminal activity.

Speciﬁcally, we set out to answer the following questions: Who
is committing these frauds? Are One Click Frauds the product of
organized criminal activities, or are they more artisanal in nature,
with many aspiring crooks trying their luck? How much do crimi-
nals stand to gain? Are there vulnerabilities in the network infras-
tructure (e.g., weak registration processes, easy access to compro-
mised accounts, etc...) that are easily exploited by the miscreants?
In the process of ﬁnding answers to these questions, a second im-
portant contribution of our paper is to provide monetary amounts,
which help dimension the size of the One Click Fraud market, and
the proﬁts potentially made. While economic modeling of cyber-
crime has been an increasingly active research topic (see for in-
stance [12,17,23,25,36]), we believe that obtaining additional mea-
surements and clearly detailing the methodology we employ should
help enrich our knowledge of how online criminal syndicates oper-
ate, while assuaging concerns on the validity of the estimates for-
mulated [14]. Furthermore, some of the measurement methodol-
ogy we employ is likely to be applicable beyond the context of One
Click Frauds.

Moreover, our analysis methodology can be helpful to law en-
forcement agencies. Law enforcement typically assigns different
fraud instances to speciﬁc agents, who mostly operate indepen-
dently of each other. However, we show that, by analyzing a rel-
atively large dataset of frauds, we can extract characteristics that
are not visible when considering smaller subsets of these frauds.
These characteristics can in turn be useful to law enforcement in

identifying, and perhaps prosecuting, the miscreants behind these
crimes [30].

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We review the
related work in Section 2. We then explain our data collection
methodology in Section 3. We turn to analyzing the data collected
in Section 4. We use this analysis to study economic incentives for
the perpetrators in Section 5, before discussing the implications of
our study, and drawing brief conclusions in Section 6.

2. RELATED WORK

Moore et al. contend that online crime has become economically
signiﬁcant since around 2004 [23]. Hence, research in measuring
the economic impact of online crime is a relatively recent ﬁeld, but
a number of papers on the topic have been published in the past
couple of years. We present several important advances in the ﬁeld
in this section, and refer the reader to Moore et al. [23] for a more
exhaustive treatment of the literature.

Some of the pioneering work in the ﬁeld has tried to quantify
the value of fraudulent ﬁnancial credentials as well as that of com-
promised hosts (“bots”), through passive observations. In particu-
lar, Thomas and Martin [31], and Franklin et al. [12] monitor IRC
channels where miscreants attempt to sell commodities as diverse
as stolen credit card numbers, bank account credentials, or email
databases for spam, to obtain estimates of the value of these items
as well as the volumes of the market associated with exchanges of
such goods.

Along the same lines, Zhuge et al. [39] describe how criminals
operate in Chinese underground markets, and provide some insight
regarding some of the goods exchanged in these markets by mon-
itoring web forums where such items are advertised; a particularly
popular item appears to be forged or stolen online video game cur-
rency.

Passive monitoring, as discussed above, has been criticized for
only measuring advertised prices, as opposed to actual realized
sales [14]. A more recent line of research addresses this concern
by actively participating in the online exchanges, by essentially
“hijacking” some of the infrastructure used by miscreants. Kanich
et al. [17] inﬁltrate a large botnet, and modify some of the spam
trafﬁc generated by the botnet to redirect purchases to a server un-
der their control, thereby acquiring data on spam conversion rates.
The key insight is that 350 million spam messages sent resulted in
28 sales. In other words, Kanich et al. measure very low conver-
sion rates in their experiment. But, considering the cost of spam
is negligible, and that bots can be used to generate other forms of
proﬁt (e.g., phishing site hosting), spam remains a relatively pop-
ular form of crime. Furthermore, a study of spam on the Twitter
social networking site [13] shows considerably higher click rates
(0.13%) than previously observed in email spam, which illustrates
that spam remains economically relevant. Other relevant measure-
ment studies include a botnet take-over described in Stone-Gross et
al. [29], who monitor the type of services supported by the Torpig
botnet. In a similar vein, Wondracek et al. [36] focus on the eco-
nomics of the distribution of pornographic materials, by covertly
operating an adult web server.

Perhaps closer in spirit to the methodology we employ in this pa-
per, a signiﬁcant body of literature [21, 22, 24] is devoted to quanti-
fying the economic impact of phishing scams, as well as the modus
operandi of the attackers. One of the main outcomes of this line
of research is to evidence that a large proportion of phishing activ-
ities are carried out by a modest number of phishing gangs, who
use relatively sophisticated “fast-ﬂux” techniques, where phishing
sites are used as disposable commodities hosted on compromised
hosts. This body of research puts the number of phishing web-

16sites at around 116,000. Likewise, Moore and Edelman [25] gather
a large corpus of data on typosquatting domains, to quantify the
economic value of such sites, as well as potential disincentives for
advertisement networks to intervene forcefully. Finally, Provos et
al. [26] provide a comprehensive overview of web-based malware
distribution, showing that there are in excess of 3 million web pages
attempting to infect their visitors.

The work we present here is complementary to the existing liter-
ature. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time One Click Frauds are
analyzed from a quantitative and technical perspective. (Research
on the legal ramiﬁcations and countermeasures, on the other hand,
has been active [18].) More generally, we focus on a relatively
contained instance of a scam, and attempt to gather both economic
data (potential revenue, deployment costs to the perpetrators...) and
structural data (number of players, relationships between players,
...) through a systematic measurement methodology, which we be-
lieve can be useful beyond the study of this speciﬁc fraud.

3. DATA COLLECTION

To ﬁnd instances of One Click Frauds, we rely on public forums
which report fraud incidents, along with details regarding the web-
site being used, the amount of money extorted, as well as fraudster
contact information (bank account number, phone number, ...). We
collect data from three public forums:
2 Channel BBS [5]: The largest bulletin board in Japan, which pro-
vides discussion threads on various topics ranging from Japanese
anime to sports. Several ongoing threads are dedicated to exposing
One Click Frauds.
Koguma-neko Teikoku [2]: Privately owned website providing
help to solve consumer problems related to online activities. A sec-
tion of the site is devoted to describing One Click Frauds, including
information about scam incidents.
Wan-Cli Zukan [7]: Privately owned website solely devoted to
exposing websites partaking in One Click Frauds.

Collection methodology. We gather data posted on the three web-
sites we polled over a period of roughly three years (2006-2009).
Speciﬁcally, we collect 2 Channel posts made between March 6,
2006 and October 26, 2009, Koguma-neko Teikoku posts made be-
tween August 24, 2006 and August 14, 2009, and Wan-Cli Zukan
posts made between September 6, 2006 and October 26, 2009. All
in all, we gathered 2,140 incident reports. Collection of this data
took place between May and November 2009. While it is difﬁcult
to determine how exhaustive our data collection is compared to the
total number of frauds perpetrated, we note that there is a signiﬁ-
cant overlap in the data provided by all three sites, which indicates
we probably captured the most successful frauds, and that our cov-
erage is likely adequate.

Initially, we also tried to extract information from data provided
by the Japanese police [32]. Unfortunately, these reports are in im-
age format, and do not contain much actionable information, even
after using optical character recognition. Indeed, most of the inter-
esting details (e.g., bank account used) are often not divulged.

Data parsing. The three sites present marked differences. 2 Chan-
nel is based on anonymous postings from various users who have
encountered a One Click Fraud website and post notiﬁcations to
other users. Due to its popularity and large user base, 2 Chan-
nel contains a wealth of information. However, because 2 Chan-
nel threads are essentially an open discussion, parsing the data
for useful input is challenging. Koguma-neko Teikoku is also a
collaborative web space, but, different from 2 Channel, Koguma-
neko Teikoku requires posters to input information about One Click
Frauds in a speciﬁed format. Finally, Wan-Cli Zukan is closer to a

blog, where the website owner periodically posts notiﬁcations in a
ﬁxed format. Outsiders cannot directly post to the site.

Parsing the data from Wan-Cli Zukan and Koguma-neko Teikoku
is straightforward, as both sites use a predetermined format for all
posts relevant to One Click Frauds. Likewise, the data is of high
quality. Randomly sampling the reported sites, we did not ﬁnd a
single instance of slander – i.e., benign sites which would be re-
ported as fraudulent. Either the sites reported were, indeed, hosting
One Click Frauds, or they had been recently taken down.

Figure 1: Example of 2 Channel posting. The lack of structure
makes parsing slightly complex. Here, usable information is
only contained in the squared area; oftentimes, formatting is
even more haphazard.

On the other hand, 2 Channel is considerably more challeng-
ing to use. An example of 2 Channel posting is shown in Fig. 1.
Since the data is not formatted according to a speciﬁc standard, we
have to perform some basic text segmentation. Adding to the difﬁ-
culty, is the fact that the Japanese language does not have a rich set
of punctuation rules. For instance, words are rarely separated by
spaces, there is no capitalization, and most characters have a cou-
ple of different readings depending on the context. Furthermore,
in forums like 2 Channel, specialized slang and abbreviations are
the norm, rather than the exception. To perform text extraction,
we use the MeCab parser and data analyzer [4]. MeCab extracts
Japanese characters into semantic units. This allows us to obtain a
list of tokens, such as “ginko” (bank), “Sumitomo” (name), “hut-
suu” (usual), “1234567.” We can then perform context-dependent
parsing. The previous series of token tells us that it is highly likely
that the poster talks about a “usual” checking account number 1234567
at Sumitomo bank.

Despite the added difﬁculty of parsing 2 Channel threads, we did
not encounter any erroneous or libelous postings. While a certain
level of verbal abuse is present in such an unmoderated forum, it is
easily separated from relevant information, once text segmentation
is performed.

Extracted attributes. For all three sources of data, after having
parsed and cleaned the input, we extract the following attributes:
URL of the fraudulent website; Bank account number given by
the fraudster for remittance of funds; Bank name; Branch name;
Account holder name; Contact phone number; Registration fee re-
quested (i.e., amount of the fraud).

Some of these attributes (e.g., account holder name) are probably
fake. However, for the fraudsters to be able to receive money, the
ﬁnancial information has to be genuine. Likewise, contact informa-

tion (email and phone numbers), when present, is usually accurate,
as miscreants provide the victims with a way of “calling back” to
further their social engineering attacks.

Table 1 describes the number of fraud incidents that we extracted
from each of the three sources of data. Note that, these sources
are not mutually exclusive.
In fact, we have signiﬁcant overlap
between the different sources.

Second, the raw data that we extract needs to be cleaned up
signiﬁcantly. A number of records are incomplete to some ex-
tent (missing phone number for example); out of these incomplete
records, particularly problematic are records that do not contain a
URL ﬁeld, as the existence of a fraud cannot be veriﬁed. In addi-
tion, a number of records are ambiguous in that some ﬁelds have
more than one entry. For instance, a given post may contain one
URL but several phone numbers. Most of these records need to be
scrutinized manually, to check whether parsing was done correctly
and whether the record indeed contains several ﬁelds.

All results are stored in a MySQL database. We illustrate a typ-
ical entry in our database in Table 2. To help make our experi-
ments reproducible, we make a copy of a dump of our database
available (in gzip’ed form) at http://arima.ini.cmu.edu/
public/oneclick.sql.gz.

After having cleaned up our original dataset, we use the extracted
URL to infer the domain hosting the fraud, and, whenever possi-
ble, to obtain registrar (“WHOIS”) information. We also period-
ically download the corresponding website (using wget in recur-
sive mode) to check for potential changes indicating a take-down,
and to check for the presence of malware on the fraudulent site.

Note that, due to the time interval (three years) over which inci-
dent reports we collect were reported, a signiﬁcant amount of data
points to sites that have long been taken down. Thus, a number of
records are hard to verify and may be missing information. For ex-
ample, we have a smaller number of entries with valid DNS domain
information, compared to the number of incidents reported.

4. DATA ANALYSIS

We next turn to analyzing the relatively large corpus of One
Click Frauds we gathered. Speciﬁcally, we seek loopholes in the
infrastructure that attackers are able to exploit. We then try to as-
sess some of the characteristics of the online criminal market be-
hind One Click Frauds, and in particular, investigate whether some
miscreants are responsible for several frauds. Last, we try to de-
termine whether fraudsters engage in other illicit activities beyond
One Click Fraud.

Table 3: Registrars used in One Click Frauds. The left table
shows the market share of the 10 most popular registrars (and
thus does not sum to 100%). The right table shows the 11 most
frequently used registrars in One Click Frauds, along with the
respective proportion of frauds they host. Numbers are ob-
tained out of the 389 fraudulent domains for which WHOIS
information was accessible.

4.1 Infrastructural loopholes

We start by checking our data corpus for evidence of repeating
patterns in the attributes we collected. The idea is that, depar-
tures from usual patterns may indicate evidence of vulnerabilities
in the infrastructure. If, for instance, a disproportionate number of
frauds uses bank accounts at Bank X, one can reasonably infer that
Bank X processes for identity veriﬁcation and account establish-
ment are ﬂawed.

We ﬁrst consider the phone numbers used by fraudsters. We are
able to identify the phone number used for callback in 516 separate
incidents. We check the phone numbers in our database against the
phone number ownership list published by the Japanese Ministry
of Internal Affairs and Communications. We ﬁnd that 38.6% of
the phone numbers used in One Click Frauds are au cellular lines,
23.3% are Softbank cellular lines, and 16.5% are local landlines for
the Tokyo area. A 2009 report about the Japanese cellular phone
market [34, pp. 78–79], tells us that au has about 25% of the market
share, while NTT Docomo represents about 50% of the market.
So, it appears that au cellular lines are signiﬁcantly targeted by
fraudsters. Whether this is due to lax registration practices, or to
easier access to compromised lines, is unclear. The large proportion
of Tokyo numbers may be explained not only by the amount of
population in that area, but also by the fact that most forwarding
services, which redirect all incoming calls to a different number
while preserving the anonymity of the callee, use Tokyo numbers.
Next, we identify the bank used in 803 separate incidents. We
observe that online banks tend to be slightly more represented in
these frauds than their actual market share should warrant. For ex-
ample, 116 frauds (14.44%) use the online Seven Bank. On the
other hand, this bank does not have as signiﬁcant a market share in
Japan [34, pp. 82–83]. eBank and JapanNet Bank are two other ex-
amples of online banks used at a notable level (around 3%) in One
Click Frauds, while holding only a small market share. A possible
explanation is that online banks do not require a physical inter-
action to let individuals open an account, and are thus potentially
more prone to abusive registrations.

Figure 2: Number of websites hosted by the resellers used in
more than one incident.

We observe even more interesting patterns, when we look at
DNS registrars and resellers that are abused by fraudsters. Table 3
compares the market share, as of Nov. 2009, of the top domain
name registrars [35] with the proportion of registrars used by do-
main names participating in One Click Frauds. We are able to iden-
tify the registrars used in 389 incidents. We note that ENom is ap-
parently much more victim of abuse than other top domain name
registrars. Likewise, Above and GMO Internet rank highly with
fraudsters, while not having signiﬁcant market share. This result
can indicate one of two possibilities: Either these registrars have
very lenient registration policies, or they entrust some of their do-
mains to resellers that are not perfectly scrupulous.

To ﬁnd out which domain name resellers are used, we examine
the DNS ﬁeld in the WHOIS record associated with the domain
used in each One Click Fraud. A large number of sites we investi-
gate have been taken down (particularly those obtained from 2006-
2007 sources). In some cases, though, the One Click Fraud sites
have been replaced by domain parking pages, and thus still have
valid WHOIS information, which may reveal information on the
reseller used. Another large number of sites use either their own
DNS server, or free DNS services like opendns.com, and are
thus discarded from analysis. We complement investigation of the
WHOIS DNS ﬁelds with a simple reverse DNS/DNS lookup script.
For instance: dig +short admovie69.com | xargs dig +short -x
yields ikero.dreamhost.com, which tells us the web hosting
service is dreamhost.com.

We eventually manage to identify the resellers in 97 incidents.
In Figure 2, we graph the number of at resellers that are used in
more than one incident. We note that, for our successful lookups,
a couple of resellers (maido3.com, value-domain.com, ...)
appear to be highly represented. They tend to be cheap resellers,
with lax, or absent registration checks.

Speciﬁcally, we investigated further maido3.com. We used
a disposable email address to request rental of a speciﬁc domain
name and server space. We used a fake name, address and phone
number, which could have been easily spotted, as the address was
that of a famous subway station. We received an immediate re-

sponse with invoicing details. A simple money transfer was all that
was needed; and this could be performed anonymously by using
cash at a convenience store. The reseller promised the site would
be up within 30 minutes of the payment being sent. No identity
checks were ever performed. In other words, this speciﬁc reseller
appeared to be easy to abuse for fraudulent activities. While we
have not attempted the same type of test with the other “popular”
resellers, we venture to guess that their registration processes are
likely easily abused as well.

4.2 Grouping miscreants

We next attempt to determine whether we can ﬁnd evidence of

paper, we qualify by “organized criminal activity” large scale oper-
ations involving many frauds, using a considerable number of bank
accounts and stolen or abused phone lines, and possibly coordi-
nating with other organizations to deploy malware or share stolen
information. We contrast such large scale operations with those
involving only a couple of sites.

Methodology. We deﬁne an undirected graph G = (V, E) as fol-
lows. We create a vertex v ∈ V for each domain name, bank
account number, or phone number our database contains. Then, we
connect vertices belonging to the same fraud with edges E. For
instance, if our database contains an entry for a fraud hosted on
example.com, with bank account number 1234567 and phone
number 080-1234-1234, we add (v1, v2, v3) = { example.com,
1234567, 080−1234−1234} to V , and three edges (e1, e2, e3) =
{v1 ↔ v2, v1 ↔ v3, v2 ↔ v3} to E. Note that, by building the
graph G in this fashion, two nodes of the same type (domain name,
bank account number, phone number) never link directly to each
other, but can be connected through an intermediary. For example,
two websites using the same phone number result in a connected
path between the three concerned nodes. One natural question is
why we chose not to link two different domain names pointing
to the same IP address. The reason is, that we realized that this
happened sometimes for sites that were markedly different, only
because they were co-hosted on the same machine by a common
reseller. In other words, both incidents shared the same web host-
ing provider, but were not related otherwise. We decided to err on
the side of caution, and not to consider identical IP addresses as a
strong indicator of identical ownership.

Parsing the entire database yields a graph with 1,341 nodes and
5,296 edges. We ﬁrst isolate 26 “singletons” representing con-
nected subgraphs containing at most three nodes, and at most one
domain name, one phone number and one bank account. These
singletons represent incidents that we cannot connect to any other
fraud. All “one-off” scams fall in this category. Excluding the 26
singletons, the whole graph G contains 105 connected subgraphs
(“clusters”), with sizes ranging from a couple of nodes and edges
to a large cluster containing 179 nodes (56 domains, 112 bank ac-
counts, 11 phone numbers), and 696 edges.

We plot the graph G in Fig. 3. While the speciﬁc domain names,
phone numbers, and bank account numbers are not readable at this
scale, we can clearly distinguish the connected subgraphs, which

connected subgraphs (e.g., top right) indicates that some miscre-
ants are operating a large number of sites, and are reusing phone
numbers or bank accounts across several sites.

While it could, in theory, be possible that two completely dif-
ferent criminals share an identical bank account number, we reject
this hypothesis, as the bank account numbers used have to be valid
for the criminals to collect their dues. Hence, a shared bank ac-
count number means that, at the very least, the miscreants sharing
the account are in a tight business relationship, and probably are the
same individual or group of individuals. Likewise, because phone
numbers used in these frauds are genuine, reusing the same phone
number across several frauds indicates a business relationship be-
tween the perpetrators.

Malware. We further noticed that websites from the second largest
connected subgraph were still alive as of Nov. 2009, indicating
that the fraud continues unabated. As mentioned earlier, we down-
loaded the entire contents of each fraudulent website listed in our
database. We found that a small number (14) of One Click Fraud
websites contained some malware.

Speciﬁcally, some of these sites contain a virus named Trojan.
HachiLem. This is an MS Windows executable ﬁle which is
posted on these sites as a “mandatory video viewer plug-in.” Once
downloaded and executed, this virus automatically collects email
addresses and contacts stored within Outlook Express or Becky!
(email application popular with Japanese enterprise users), and sends
the collected information to a central hachimitsu-lemon.com
server and, possibly, to another machine as well. The collected
email information is in turn used to blackmail victims and notify
them they owe the website registration fees. Interestingly enough
hachimitsu-lemon.com has not been a valid domain name
since, at least, early October 2009, but a report about this virus was
posted as recently as Oct. 26th, 2009 on Wan-Cli Zukan, indicating
that this virus is still mildly active.

Another group of sites contains a simpler, less intrusive form of
malware, which modiﬁes the Windows registry entries to display a
pop up window reminding of the registration fee due upon boot-up.

Additional clustering. An interesting feature of the sites hosting the
Trojan.HachiLem malware is that they all share strong simi-
larities in their WHOIS records. For instance, the technical contact
phone number ﬁeld contains is identical (+81-6-6241-6585). While
it is likely a bogus number, this similarity, coupled with the pres-
ence of identical malware and overall similar appearance of the dif-
ferent websites involved strongly suggest all sites are operated by
the same group. We can thus relate six connected subgraphs to each
other, represented by the dashed boxes in Fig. 3.

We further look into WHOIS information details, and notice that
a number of registrant entries shared similarities across seemingly
different incidents. For example, we found a number of entries
with identical (bogus) contact name, email information, or techni-
cal contact phone number. By grouping this entries together, we
can link seven connected subgraphs, represented by the thick dot-
ted boxes in Fig. 3, to each other.

Fraud distribution. With the assumption that each connected sub-
graph denotes a unique criminal organization, we plot, in Fig. 4, (a)
the number of frauds perpetrated by each group, and (b) the cumu-
lative number of frauds perpetrated by the most active fraudsters.

In Fig. 4(a), we rank criminals by the number of frauds they have
been committing, and plot the number of One Click Frauds perpe-
trated by each group as a function of its rank. We provide data for
both simple clustering (based only on phone numbers, domains,
and bank accounts), as well as additional clustering (further group-

ing criminals by malware used, and identical WHOIS records). We
note that the distribution seems to be following a Zipf law. Specif-
ically, the curve representing a basic clustering ﬁts very well with
the function y = 56/x0.76; and y = 80/x0.90 is a good ﬁt for
the curve obtained by considering additional clustering. The match
with a power law indicates both high concentration (a few people
are responsible for most of the frauds), and long tail behavior (many
people participate in these scams).

Fig. 4(b) plots the same data as Fig. 4(a), but in a cumulative
fashion. What we observe here, is that even with our conserva-
tive clustering strategy, the top 13 miscreant groups are responsible
more than 50% of the fraud. Taking into account similarities exhib-
ited by WHOIS records, and malware deployment, we observe that
the top 8 groups are responsible for more than half of the frauds we
have collected. At the same time, there is a large number of groups
that do not seem to be involved in more than at most a couple of
frauds. Including singletons, 80 out of the 112 groups we extracted
using additional clustering, or about 71% of the criminals involved,
appear to operate at most two sites. This number may be an over-
estimate, since we do not claim that we managed to establish all
possible links that exist. Yet, it tends to indicate that the miscreant
population is a mix of large operators, and of “artisans” running
much more limited criminal enterprises.

Table 4: Presence of One Click Fraud domains in various
blacklists.

Next, we try to see if domains engaging in One Click Fraud are
also supporting other illicit activities. Out of 1608 URLs present
in our database, we extract 842 domain names. These domains
resolve to 275 unique IP addresses.3

We check the 275 IP addresses against a set of eight blacklisting
services that ﬂag IP addresses known for producing large amounts
of spam, and/or trojans and malware, and present our results in
Table 4. While some of the domains are also used for spam, the
vast majority does not appear in any database.
In fact, most of
the hits we see (in L2.apews.org) are coming from sites that
resolve to a parked domain IP address. That is, these sites are not

3A large number of domains, particularly those reported in 2006–
2007, are down, and do not resolve to any IP address anymore.

active as One Click Frauds anymore, and have been reclaimed by
the DNS reseller, which apparently either serves as a spam relay
or has been known to be friendly to spammers. Given the results
we found earlier about the concentration of frauds in some speciﬁc
resellers, this outcome is not particularly surprising.

We further verify this hypothesis by checking our entries against
the Google Safe Browsing database for phishing and malware dis-
tributed as part of Firefox 3, updated as of July 24, 2010. None
of the URLs we ﬁnd in our database is listed in the Google Safe
Browsing database.

However, we also want to check IP addresses of the servers that
host One Click Frauds against the IP addresses of the servers host-
ing pages listed in the Google Safe Browsing database. Recent
versions of the database, such as that used in Firefox 3, only con-
tain hashes of the blacklisted domains rather than the actual domain
information, which makes it impractical to obtain IP addresses as-
sociated with the blacklisted domains. We thus turn to an older
version of the Google Safe Browsing database (bundled with Fire-
fox 2, last updated on June 29, 2008), which contains the black-
listed domains in plaintext.4 In this older database too, none of the
URLs match blacklist entries, but, when comparing IP addresses
of the servers that host One Click Frauds to the IP addresses of
the servers in the blacklist, we see a signiﬁcant (16%) number of
hits. This conﬁrms our ﬁnding that, while the websites engaging in
One Click Frauds keep a relatively low proﬁle, they are sometimes
hosted on very questionable servers, which essentially turn a blind
eye to what their customers are doing.

A possible reason for the relatively lack of conclusive evidence
that One Click Frauds sites engage in other forms of online crime
will become clear in the next section, when we look at the potential
proﬁts miscreants can make. Operating a set of One Click Fraud
sites is indeed quite a proﬁtable endeavor, and we conjecture that,
engaging in other forms of fraud would only have a marginal ben-
eﬁt to the fraudster, while increasing the risk of getting caught.

5. ECONOMIC INCENTIVES

We next turn to looking into the proﬁtability of One Click Frauds.
We start by drafting a very simple economic model, before popu-
lating it with the measurements we obtained from our study. The
objective is not to obtain very precise estimates of the actual proﬁts
that can be made, but mostly to dimension the incentives (or dis-
incentives) to engage in One Click Frauds. We ﬁrst determine the

break-even point in the absence of potential risks for miscreants,
before looking at the impact of penalties (prison, ﬁnes) on crimi-
nals’ incentives. All the numbers in this section are current as of
November 2009.

5.1 Cost-beneﬁt analysis

Costs. A miscreant interested in setting up a One Click Fraud will
need a computer and Internet access. We call this startup cost,
Cinit. Cinit is independent of the number of frauds carried out, but
is actually dependent on time, as Internet access is usually provided
as a monthly subscription service. Then, the miscreant will need to
purchase a DNS name, possibly joint with a web hosting service.
We will call this cost Chost. This cost, too, is time-dependent.

The website has then to be populated with contents (e.g., porno-
graphic images, dating databases), which will cost Ccont. Ccont
can be a ﬁxed price, or a periodic fee, depending on whether the
miscreant is purchasing items in bulk, or as part of a syndicated
service.

The criminal has to set up a bank account, which should not be
traceable back to its real identity. We will assume the cost of this
operation to be Cbank. This is a ﬁxed fee. Likewise, an untraceable
phone number for call-back from the victim may be purchased to
make the fraud more successful. We will denote the cost associated
with this purchase Cphone. This fee is likely to be time-dependent;
for example, the forwarding service discussed in Section 4 is a
monthly subscription.

Proﬁts. Proﬁts primarily come from money obtained through user
payment Puser, conditioned by the number of users n paying the
requested amount f for each incident. The number of users in-
creases with time. Secondary proﬁts, Presale, may be reaped from
reselling databases of victims contact information to other miscre-
ants.

Utility. As we have discussed before, miscreants may actually set
up several frauds, potentially reusing phone numbers and bank ac-
counts across them. Let us denote by S, K, and B the number of
frauds set up, phone numbers, and bank accounts purchased by a
miscreant, respectively. We assume that identical contents is reused
across all frauds operated by the same miscreant, which, based on
casual observation, appears to be the case. We further assume that
hosting costs are directly proportional to the number of sites op-
erated, which is a very conservative assumption, as resellers tend
to provide discounts based on the number of domains purchased.
We also assume that the costs of phone and banking services are
directly proportional to the number of phone lines and banking ac-

counts purchased. This assumption holds, because Japanese phone
companies does not rely on usage-based charging for incoming
calls. Cellular lines use dedicated area codes, so that the caller,
in this case, the victim, pays a premium compared to the charge for
calling a landline. Hence, in One Click Frauds, because miscre-
ants only use their lines for incoming calls, they are not charged for
usage.

Finally, because quantifying Presale is difﬁcult, and is likely to
be small in front of the other proﬁts, we simply consider Presale ≥
0. Finally, we assume that each fraud has roughly the same prob-
ability of being successful, and thus, that the total number of users
to fall for all frauds operated by a miscreant is simply given by
multiplying S by n.

With these assumptions, we obtain, for the utility (i.e., the proﬁt
or loss miscreants can expect) U , the following inequality, in ab-
sence of any risks linked to being caught:

U (t) ≥ Sn(t)f − Cinit(t)

−S(Chost(t) + Ccont) − BCbank − KCphone ,(1)

where t denotes time. Clearly, the policy maker wants U < 0. If,
on the other hand, U ≫ 0, there is a high incentive for people to
start fraudulent operations.

5.2 Fraud proﬁtability

We next turn to dimensioning each of the parameters in Eqn. (1).

We consider t = 1 year in all discussions.

We plot the number of occurrences the most commonly requested
amounts of money f are observed in our database in Fig. 5. The
spike at 45,001-50,000 JPY (roughly USD 500) coincides with the
average monthly amount of “pocket money” typical Japanese busi-
nessmen are allowed to take from the household income (45,600
JPY in 2008, [27]).5 The average, over 1,268 records in our database,
stands at f = 60, 462 JPY.

Next, the initial cost Cinit combines that of a computer, which
the fraudster likely already possesses, and of an Internet subscrip-
tion.
If the miscreant does not already own a computer, a basic
model, around 28,000 JPY (e.g., an Asus EeePC 900X), would be
more than sufﬁcient. Likewise, the miscreant probably already sub-
scribes to an Internet service, but assuming they do not, a modest

5In Japan, the wife of the household typically plays the role of

husband and children.

broadband access is all that they need. As an example, in 2009, Ya-
hoo! BroadBand provides an ADSL “8 Mbps” plan for 3,904 JPY
per month [8]. We get 0 ≤ Cinit ≤ 74, 848 JPY, where the upper
bound is given by assuming a fully dedicated machine and Internet
connection for setting up One Click Frauds, and is obtained com-
bining the prices of purchasing a new PC and subscribing for one
year to the Internet service.

We evaluate Chost using maido3.com, a domain reseller and
rental server popular with fraudsters (see Section 4). The Starter
Pack Plan costs 3,675 JPY for an initial setup fee; domain registra-
tion and DNS service is free; the plan requires a three months ad-
vance payment of 22,050 JPY (monthly fee is 7,350 JPY). We gath-
ered these numbers from our email communication with maido3.
com. For a one-year subscription, we obtain Chost = 91, 875 JPY.
Fraudulent bank accounts can be obtained for prices going be-
tween 30,000 and 50,000 JPY [1] from the black market. As pre-
viously mentioned in Section 4, bank accounts are easily forged if
created in Internet banks or banks requiring only postal mail for
new contracts since there is no physical interaction during the con-
tracting process. Also, it is relatively easy to set up fraudulent ac-
counts by taking advantage of the Japanese writing system. Bank
accounts internally use a phonetic alphabet (katakana), different
from the characters used for most names and nouns (kanji). It is
thus possible to create ambiguous account names. For instance,
both the “Baking Club of Shirai City” and “Shiraishi Mitsuko” (a
person’s name) are pronounced exactly the same, and thus would
have the same account holder information. By registering as a non-
proﬁt organization, the fraudster may easily bypass most identity
checks, and subsequently set up fraudulent transfers using the in-
dividual name instead. Creating an account in this fashion would
cost much lower than 50,000 JPY. We can thus conﬁdently assume
Cbank ≤ 50, 000 JPY.

A phone line is required for miscreants to have the ability to fur-
ther pressure and blackmail the victim to pay money. Cell phones
can be illegally purchased for approximately 35,000 JPY [1,3], and
can be made untraceable by paying the monthly subscription fees
of 7,685 JPY/month [3] at a convenience store, or by simply using a
prepaid phone. Forwarding and anonymizing services discussed in
Section 4 can be purchased for only 840 JPY/month [6]. Assuming
all these services are purchased for a year yields an upper bound
Cphone ≤ 137, 300 JPY.

We make the modestly controversial assumption that Ccont = 0.
Indeed, we suspect that most of the pornographic contents pre-
sented in One Click Fraud websites is simply copied and plagia-
rized from other (non-fraudulent) websites, or obtained through
peer-to-peer transfers.

Last, our analysis of Section 4 tells us that, on average, S ≈
3.7 domains, while B ≈ 5.2 accounts, and K ≈ 1.3 phone lines.
These numbers are obtained by looking at the graph G, and di-
viding, the total number of domains operated (481), bank accounts
(684), and phone numbers used (176), by the number of connected
subgraphs we found, including singletons (131).

Reusing these numbers in Eqn (1), we obtain a simple linear
condition for the fraud to be economically viable, that is, for U ≥
0, we need

n ≥ 3.8 users

to fall for each fraud, within one year. This means that, as long as,
for each scam operated, more than four people fall for the scam
within a year, the miscreant turns a proﬁt. In other words, there
is an extremely strong incentive for aspiring criminals to engage in
One Click Fraud. This strong incentive is not very surprising, given
the low amount of skills and equipment needed to set up One Click

23Frauds. What we ﬁnd more interesting is how proﬁtable One Click
Fraud appears to be.

5.3 Legal aspects

The above incentive assessment ignores the probability of get-
ting caught, and the associated penalties resulting from arrest, which
we detail next.

Prosecution probability. Criminals take advantage of social norms
and legal loopholes to commit One Click Frauds. First, most vic-
tims do not report these crimes. Indeed, to be able to legally charge
a suspect, a victim must make a formal complaint to the court. Due
to the embarrassment associated with the context of the fraud, many
victims do not wish to participate in the accusations that may reveal
their identity. Further complicating matters, is the fact that most
DNS resellers and web hosting services used, as we have observed
in our measurements, are physically situated outside of Japan. The
part of the fraud infrastructure hosted in Japan, i.e., the phone line
and the bank account, is equally hard to use for investigation. In-
deed, police cannot obtain contact and network information from
telecommunication networks unless they have an actual arrest war-
rant. Likewise, access to banking accounts is very restricted. Thus,
prosecution probability is actually very low.

Penalties.
In addition, sentences are relatively light. Common
fraud (e.g., blackmail), in Japan, carries a sentence of up to 10 years
of imprisonment. However, One Click Frauds very often do not
meet the legal tests necessary for qualifying as “fraud,” as in the
vast majority of cases, the victim pays up immediately, and there
is no active blackmailing effort from the miscreant. One could ar-
gue that they are nothing more than a sophisticated form of pan-
handling. As a result, the few sentences for cases related to One
Click Fraud made public [2] were rather light, with ﬁnes ranging
from 300,000 JPY to 2,000,000 JPY (≈ USD 3,000 to 20,000) and
prison sentences ranging from probation to 2.5 years of jail time.

5.4 Field measurements

We next use ﬁeld data provided by the Japanese police [15], and
compare their ﬁndings to ours. Note that the report [15] combines
numbers for One Click Frauds and related conﬁdence scams, so the
numbers in this section are much more approximate than we would
wish. However, they remain a useful starting point to roughly as-
sess the economic impact of these frauds.

Number of frauds per miscreant. First, the police acknowledges
2,859 cases of frauds leading to 657 arrests. It is very unlikely that
the police would inﬂate the number of unsolved cases in an external
publication, and it thus appears that each arrested individual was
responsible for an average of 4.4 frauds.6 This number is slightly
higher than S = 3.7 we found earlier, but the difference is hardly
surprising, as the probability of getting caught increases with the
number of sites operated.

Proﬁts made. The Japanese Police estimates, on average, between
2004 and 2008, that 26 billion JPY per year were swindled in var-
ious conﬁdence scams, prominently including One Click Frauds.
Dividing by the number of 2,859 cases the police reports, we ﬁnd
the average income per case to be approximately 9 million JPY over
a year (≈ 90,000 USD), a quite staggering number, especially con-
sidering that each arrested individual was responsible for about four
cases, potentially making around 360,000 USD. While we believe
that this is likely an over-estimate, due to the unpublished number

6In Japan, arrests are usually made only when the police is certain
with 99% probability or more of the suspect’s guilt. The conviction
rate is thus very high.

Table 5: Press reports of One Click Fraud arrests.

of unsolved cases, as well as, some potential exaggeration in the
losses incurred, the proﬁt made by miscreants in practice appears
sizable.

We can compare this estimate with reports gathered from the
press, which we summarize in Table 5. The proﬁts made appear to
be very high, which is not overly surprising considering the num-
ber of victims involved. Recall from the previous section, that one
only needs about four victims to break even. Clearly, with vic-
tim numbers in the 450–10,000 range, we can expect very signiﬁ-
cant proﬁts, which, in Table 5 are estimated between approximately
USD 28,000 and 600,000 for each group arrested. Thus, the USD
90,000 – 360,000 estimate acquired from the police reports seems
to be in the right order of magnitude.

Ironically, the case reported in [38] names the suspect as a fa-
mous IT writer specializing in cybercrime and appearing in mul-
tiple TV programs to warn the public of the dangers of One Click
Fraud. One cannot help but think that the suspect, being very famil-
iar with the inner working of One Click Fraud, must have reached
a conclusion identical to that of the present paper, that is, that there
is a signiﬁcant economic advantage to engage in such frauds.

We also note that these arrests were likely possible by the sheer
magnitude of the fraud. A criminal conﬁning themselves to only
a few dozens victims would likely be able to make a reasonable
proﬁt, while being hard to catch.

6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive picture of a con-
ﬁdence scam used in Japan, called One Click Fraud. By gathering
over 2,000 reports of incidents from vigilante websites, we were
able to describe a number of potential vulnerabilities that miscre-
ants use (lax registration checks, resellers turning a blind eye to
their customers’ activities), and also showed that the market ap-
pears to be quite heavily concentrated. The top eight miscreant
groups are responsible for more than half the frauds we uncovered.
At the same time, a large number of individuals seem to be partici-
pating in frauds of smaller magnitude.

We showed that an important reason for these scams to ﬂourish
is the strong economic incentives miscreants have. They can break
even as soon as they manage to successfully scam four victims for
each fraud, and, on average can make proﬁts in the order of USD
10,000-100,000 or more per year. Prosecution is difﬁcult, since
victims are reluctant to come forward, and the penalties that can be
meted are relatively light.

Reforming the law to impose harsher penalties is not easy, as
proving the mere existence of a crime is cumbersome. On the other
hand, prevention, identiﬁcation, and take-down seems more feasi-
ble. Our study shows that identifying perpetrators can greatly bene-
ﬁt from a bird’s eye view of the network. In our discussions with the
police, we learned that different cases are usually assigned to sep-
arate ofﬁcers, and that communication could be greatly improved.
For instance, one ofﬁcer may investigate a fraudulent phone num-
ber, while another may be investigating an online fraud.
If the

24phone number is used in said fraud, clearly both ofﬁcers would
beneﬁt from sharing the results of their investigations. However,
such holistic approaches remain relatively rare in practice.

Future work. We believe that, while we tried to provide as compre-
hensive a study as possible, we could enrich the data we obtained by
looking for connections with other forms of crime in more details.
Our conclusions, thus far, are that these domains do not apparently
engage in other forms of fraud, but are based on a relatively simple
check of known blacklists. Studying in more details WHOIS reg-
istrations cross-listings, as well as possible connections with more
“mainstream” pornographic sites could reveal further insights.

Also, an article issued at the time of this writing [9] shows that
One Click Fraud is now using peer-to-peer software as a prop-
agation vector for viruses very similar to Trojan.HachiLem.
While the propagation method is new, the psychological factors
making such scams successful remain the same. Finding how to
address these psychological traits is a promising area of research,
quite related to ongoing works in security psychology [28].

We have also observed, in the police records that we eventually
were not able to use, that 71 out of 359 scams reported were SMS-
based. That is, One Click Frauds are also affecting mobile web-
sites. Whether the perpetrators are the same, or different groups,
remains unknown, and would warrant further investigation.

Despite being focused on a very speciﬁc crime, we believe that
some of the methodology we used in this paper (graph-theory based
modeling, and clustering techniques, for example) could very well
apply to other forms of online frauds. As mentioned in the intro-
duction, One Click Frauds are closely related to the more general
body of scareware scams, and some of the techniques we use could
equally apply to analyzing scareware markets. More generally, we
hope this paper will help facilitate an ambitious research agenda to
gather more data from online criminal activities. An improved un-
derstanding of the economics of online crime is indeed essential in
determining which policies may work to curb the problem.
