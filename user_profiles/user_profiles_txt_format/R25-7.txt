This paper reviews existing measures used for evaluating the usability of information systems and those used for evaluating the
level of the productivity of a company. We discuss the usefulness of the existing measures in the mobile business context, where
both mobility and work-context pose speciﬁc demands for the mobile business services. The review showed that the existing
measures rarely consider the great contextual variation caused by the mobility of the services and the demands this poses on
usability; which, in turn, aﬀects productivity. To build a measurement tool that better meets the requirements of mobile business
services, we completed case studies on two mobile business services, one used in passenger transport and the other in construction
sites. Based on the understanding gained from the case studies, we propose a list of dimensions and items addressing both usability
and productivity aspects that work as the basis for a multidisciplinary measurement tool.

1. Introduction

Mobile business services have great potential for beneﬁting
both the individual workers and the companies deploying
them. These business-oriented services are used via mobile
devices (e.g., mobile phone or PDA), for example, to access
corporate information systems and the Internet or for
collecting data in the ﬁeld (e.g., [1, 2]). Both the companies
developing and deploying these services would beneﬁt from
a tool that measures their success. This tool could be used for
benchmarking and evaluating the new versions of the service,
for evaluating the success of the service against competitors,
and for evaluating the possible beneﬁts the service could
provide for the end users and companies deploying the
service.

Despite the potential beneﬁts, it remains a challenge
to measure how successful the services actually are. One
challenge in providing a tool for measuring success lies in
the fact that success means diﬀerent things for the diﬀerent
stakeholders: the users of the service might emphasise
the easiness of use while improved productivity is often

mentioned as one of the main beneﬁts from the perspective
of the company (e.g., [3, 4]). These views on success are not
necessarily contradictory; often the easy-to-use service is also
more successful ﬁnancially. For example, if the service is easy
to use, the need for training decreases and then users can
focus on working instead of taking part in training courses
or seeking online help [5]. The bottom line is that the success
of a mobile business service use cannot be determined
by utilizing one factor alone—both usability and business
aspects need to be considered together.

Another challenge in the development of a tool for
measuring success lies in the fact that such tool needs to
take into account the context. From a technical view, mobile
context includes, for example, the network infrastructure,
the broader computational system, and the actual physical
environment [6]. According to Vartiainen [7], connections
(e.g., Internet, WLAN, broadband), devices, as well as
applications and services construct virtual spaces that enable
communication and collaboration. Moreover, Vartiainen [7]
deﬁnes physical environments as settings and environments
such as home, oﬃces, cars, and hotels, where the mobile

2

Advances in Human-Computer Interaction

services are used. In addition to environmental context
(including physical and social contexts), mobile context also
includes personal context from the user’s point of view [8].
According to Lee et al. [8], emotion, time, and movement are
three important factors related to personal context.

On the basis of examining work in a mobile context,
recent studies concluded that there is the so-called “anytime,
anywhere” paradox [9], that is, time frames of mobile work
are not always negotiable, nor are the places where mobile
work take place. On the other hand, Sørensen et al. [10]
stated that in the mobile work context, supporting smart
work processes is the key in keeping the dynamic work
environment in control. This control, in turn, ensures safer
and more economic work environment [10]. Moreover, we
believe that the complexity of the mobile work context has an
eﬀect on measuring the success factors. Mobility is not only
“a matter of location in time and space” [11] as the mobility
can be spatial, temporal, and contextual [12].

In this paper, we will ﬁrst present a review on the
state of the art of the measurement tools for usability and
productivity. To better understand whether the current tools
are suﬃcient for the mobile business context, we will present
ﬁndings from two case studies. One of the case studies was
done on a mobile taxi dispatching system and another on
a mobile safety-measurement service used at construction
sites. In the case studies, we explored factors that have an
eﬀect on the success of mobile business services. In addition,
we will highlight the shortcomings of the current way of
measuring success—why some measures are not suitable
or optimal in this context and why none of the existing
measurement tools are suﬃcient alone. As a result, the paper
presents a pool of items that will be used for developing
a questionnaire for evaluating some key success factors of
mobile business services from the individual user’s point of
view.

2. Measuring Usability

According to ISO 9241 [13] standard, usability is an extent
to which the intended users of a product achieve speciﬁed
goals in an eﬀective, eﬃcient and satisfactory manner within
a speciﬁed context of use. This section presents an overview
on the existing tools and metrics for measuring usability and
discusses their limitations in the context of mobile business
services.

2.1. Measuring User’s Performance
Eﬀectiveness—or the accuracy and completeness with which
intended goals are achieved—can be measured by the
percent or number of errors, the success-failure ratio, or the
percentage of tasks completed. Eﬃciency is a measure of
the amount of human, economic, and temporal resources
that are expended in attaining a required level of product
eﬀectiveness. Measures of eﬃciency include time taken to
complete tasks, time spent using help or documentation,
and estimations of subjective workload (mental eﬀort).
Satisfaction refers to the comfort in using the system and
its overall functionality. Useful measures of user satisfaction

include the number of times the interface misleads the
user or the user loses control of the system, the percent of
favourable/unfavourable comments, and ratings on post-test
questionnaires.

According to Nielsen [14], another way to deﬁne usability
is through the concepts of learnability, memorability, eﬃ-
ciency, subjective satisfaction, and low rate of errors. For
example, learnability can be measured as the beginners’ time
to attain the average skills with the system and eﬃciency
by considering how fast and accurately a practiced user can
work with the system. In relation to errors, it is important to
separate between errors that are repairable (users can recover
from them) and errors that lead to a catastrophic failure.

2.2. Measuring User’s Subjective Opinions

Quantitatively, user’s perceived usability ratings are often
collected using questionnaires. A number of usability ques-
tionnaires have been carefully developed and tested for
their psychometric qualities, such as (SUS) [15], Software
Usability Measurement Inventory (SUMI) [16], Question-
naire for User Interface Satisfaction (QUIS) [17], The After-
Scenario Questionnaire (ASQ), Post-Study System Usability
Questionnaire (PSSUQ), The Computer System Usability
Questionnaire (CSUQ) (all three by [18]), and measurement
scales for perceived usefulness and ease of use [19]. The
questionnaires do not only focus on user satisfaction,
but also study how users perceive the other attributes of
usability.

The questionnaires diﬀer in the number and contents
of the constructs they measure. For example, SUS consists
of 10 statements that cover several aspects of usability,
such as the need for support, training, and complexity;
QUIS, on the other hand, studies eleven dimensions, such
as screen factors, terminology, system feedback, learning
factors, and system capabilities. In both SUS and QUIS,
the items focus on the use of the system (e.g., “Overall
reactions to software,” “System speed”) and on the details of
the user interface or system functionality (e.g., “I found the
various functions of the system were well integrated”). On
the other hand, the three items in ASQ focus on tasks (e.g.,
“Overall, I am satisﬁed with the ease of completing the tasks
in this scenario”); PSSUQ and CSUQ include items with
system, task, and interface focus. The measurement scales for
perceived usefulness and ease of use by Davis’s Technology
Acceptance Model (TAM) [19] focus speciﬁcally on the use
of the system in the context of work tasks.

There are also some models and questionnaires that are
speciﬁcally developed for mobile devices and services. For
example, the applied TAM for Mobile services (TAMM)
extends the original TAM with two new perceived product
characteristics aﬀecting the intention to use: trust and ease of
adoption. In addition, TAMM model redeﬁnes the theme of
usefulness as value to the user [20]. In addition, the Value-
based Adoption Model (VAM) extends TAM by explaining
customer’s mobile internet adoption from the perceived
value perspective including usefulness, enjoyment, fee, and
technicality [21]. The Mobile Phone Usability Questionnaire
(MPUQ) evaluates the usability of mobile phones for the

Advances in Human-Computer Interaction

purpose of making decisions among competing variations
in the end-user market, alternatives of prototypes during
the development process, and evolving versions during an
iterative design process. In addition, the questionnaire can
serve as a tool for identifying diagnostic information to
improve speciﬁc usability dimensions and related interface
elements [22]. Moreover, Wehmeyer [23] has developed an
initial instrument for assessing users’ attachment to their
mobile devices by three dimensions: symbolism, aesthet-
ics, and perceived necessity. However, all these previously
mentioned methods are developed for consumer products
and services. Thus, there is still a need for analysing the
characteristics of mobile business services that are used in
a work context. The networked nature of the mobile work
system requires further extensions to user acceptance and
usability measures.

2.3. Combining Objective and

Subjective Measures

The usability research publications often report results in
relation to the three factors of usability mentioned in
the ISO standard [13], namely, satisfaction, eﬃciency, and
eﬀectiveness. However, these constructs are often reported
separately: one system is reported as more eﬃcient than
the other, whereas, in relation to eﬀectiveness, the results
do not diﬀer between the interfaces. Subjective satisfac-
tion is often used to give additional testimony on the
superiority of one interface over the other. A reasonable
question is whether all the diﬀerent aspects of usability
need to be studied or whether one would be suﬃcient: if
eﬀectiveness, eﬃciency, and subjective satisfaction all point
to the same direction, maybe it is enough to simply (and
cheaply) ask the user how much they liked the service
and use this score as an indication of the usability of the
service.

Nielsen and Levy [24] reviewed 57 studies and concluded
that although there is a clear association between subjective
satisfaction and task performance, there are still many cases
where the “users prefer systems that are measurably worse for
them” [24]. Later, Frøkjær et al. [25] showed that correlations
between the three aspects of usability are dependent on
the application domain, the user’s experience, and the use
context, and that no simple correlation between the three
can be expected. Especially, for complex “nonroutine” tasks,
eﬃciency measures as indicators of usability are useless if
the task completion (eﬀectiveness) is not taken into account
[25]. Hornbæk [26] also encourages the measurement of
all the three aspects of usability with both subjective and
objective methods. However, Hornbæk [26] does not limit
the subjective measures to subjective satisfaction. Instead,
many objective measures, such as task time, can also be
evaluated subjectively: the objective task time with System
A may be faster than with System B, but the perceived time
may be well faster with System B. The implications such
results warrant are dependent on the situation, but overall,
the results can give important information on the usability
of the system.

3. Measuring Productivity

It is widely agreed that IT investments in general have
an impact on the output of the company and thus, on
productivity (e.g., [27]). Productivity is a multidimensional
term and its meaning can vary depending on the context
in which it is used [28]. Productivity can be deﬁned simply
as output divided by the input that is used to generate the
output: input consists of materials, labour, capital, energy,
and so forth, and output consists of products, services
or information (e.g., [28–30]). This section provides an
overview on the existing tools for measuring productivity
of a company. In addition, the limitations of measuring
productivity improvement resulting from the use of mobile
business services are discussed.

3.1. Traditional Productivity Measurement

Traditionally, productivity measures have been categorised
as either total productivity measures or partial productivity
measures [29]. In practise, the measurement of total produc-
tivity (i.e., comparing all outputs with all inputs) is diﬃcult
as diﬀerent types of outputs and inputs cannot be summed
up and compared directly. Therefore, partial productivity
measures are commonly used. Partial productivity ratio can
be calculated by dividing the total output by one input
or some portion of inputs [29]. Labour productivity is a
most common example of this kind of measure and it is
usually used when measuring the impacts of IT investments.
Labour productivity is the ratio calculated by dividing the
total output (e.g., number of products) by labour input (e.g.,
man-hour) [31].

Moreover, indirect productivity measurement can be used
when the data needed for partial productivity measures is not
available. The idea behind indirect productivity measures is
that certain symptoms or phenomena are related to problems
in productivity. They include, for example, high defect
rates, machine defects, unused capacity, high material scrap,
unnecessary transports, poor atmosphere, and long waiting
times (e.g., [30, 32]). Indirect productivity measures focus
on these factors which are closely related to productivity and
which can be used to explain the reasons behind the changes
in productivity [31].

According to Misterek et al. [29], the problem with
productivity measures is that they do not take into account
changes in the quality of the inputs or outputs. Especially
in service business, quality and productivity cannot be dealt
separately [33]. Moreover, measuring the eﬀects of mobile
business services on productivity with these traditional
measures may be diﬃcult because of business process
changes and indirect inﬂuences (e.g., improved customer
satisfaction) these services cause [34]. For example, Bryn-
jolfsson and Hitt [35] noted that information technology
investment may create intangible assets which in turn may
have a positive impact on the productivity of the company
but are not included in traditional evaluations. Including
intangible aspects could provide a more accurate and realistic
view of returns as a result of the investment [36].

3.2. Subjective Productivity Measurement

The use of the traditional productivity measurement meth-
ods presented above requires collecting quantitative data
from operations. Sometimes the inputs and output are not
easily quantiﬁable and it may be diﬃcult or even impos-
sible to collect the data that is needed for productivity
measurement. For example, in service work, inputs and
outputs are usually intangible and the quality may vary a
lot. In these cases, subjective productivity measurement is one
possible method to collect the needed information about the
level of or problems in productivity. Subjective productivity
measures are based on personnel’s subjective assessments
and data is usually collected using surveys or interviews (see,
e.g., [31, 37]). As traditional objective productivity measures,
also subjective measures can be direct or indirect. Direct pro-
ductivity measures can be, for example, partial productivity
ratios (objective) or survey questions regarding employees’
perceptions of their own productivity (subjective). Indirect
productivity measures can be, for example, unused capacity,
unnecessary transports, and long waiting times (objective)
or survey questions concerning employees’ perceptions of
waiting times needed (subjective) [31].

As subjective measurement is also a common way of
measuring usability, it could provide a basis for combining
usability and productivity perspectives. In addition, it could
be a good way of including intangible aspects (such as
quality) when measuring the productivity impacts of mobile
business services.

4. Exploring the Success Factors of

Mobile Business Services

The main aim of this paper was to study the factors that have
an eﬀect on the success of mobile business services and to
construct a preliminary measurement tool for measuring the
level of success. Given the variability of tools already available
for measuring usability and productivity (the ones reviewed
in previous sections and much more), why would anyone
want to develop yet another set of tools? For us, there were
two main reasons: ﬁrst, the current tools do not address
the speciﬁc context we are interested in, namely, mobile
services for business use, and second, the current tools only
address either usability—or productivity-related issues—and
we strongly feel that both of them need to be addressed
in order to measure success. In order to understand the
characteristics and success factors of mobile services that
are used in a mobile work context, we conducted two case
studies.

In the ﬁrst case study, we examined a mobile business
service used for taxi booking and dispatching. Taxi drivers
use the service constantly in their daily work while driving.
The service is used, for example, for accepting incoming
requests, searching customers’ addresses and other locations
on the map, and messaging to the dispatching centre and
other taxis. The service is used on a ﬁxed in-car device.
In the second case study, we studied a mobile business
service that is used at construction sites for weekly safety
measurements. Safety delegate observes various safety issues

at the construction site and uses the mobile service to
document the observations. This service is used on a mobile
phone.

4.1. Methods and Participants

Our goal is to gain understanding of the phenomena, that
is, measuring the success factors of mobile business services,
and we are using qualitative research methods to gain that
understanding. Therefore, our study is based on an inter-
pretive research paradigm whereby we aim at understanding
the context of the system better (see [7]) (cf. the positivist
paradigm where the assumption is that the measurable
properties of the phenomenon are not dependent of the
single observer). As data collection methods, we used focus
groups, interviews, and observations. The data collection
took place during the spring 2006.

For the ﬁrst case study, we conducted two focus groups
with a total of nine taxi drivers and two pair interviews
with dispatchers to analyze the success factors in their
mobile work context while using the taxi order booking
and dispatching system. To evaluate the service from the
perspective of new users, we observed the training of almost
50 taxi driver candidates during three three-hour training
sessions. During these sessions, the candidates used the
mobile service to complete typical usage scenarios in a
classroom setting. To evaluate the ﬂow of interaction and
other usability issues of the taxi drivers’ system, two usability
specialists spent one hour using a demonstration system
to complete typical taxi driver’s tasks (such as accepting
a customer order, locating an address from the map, and
changing the settings of the interface). To gain a wide
business perspective on the themes related to the success
of the mobile business service, we interviewed the taxi
company’s managing director and the chairman of the board.
For the second case study, we had one group discussion
at a construction site, where we discussed the use of the
service with the representatives of the construction company
and the service provider. In addition, we interviewed one
user at another construction site and observed three users
at two diﬀerent construction sites while using the mobile
service to perform safety measurement. To better understand
the challenges and opportunities that the new service brings
along, we also observed the traditional safety measurement
process where the safety measurement was done by ﬁlling in
a paper form. After the observations, we asked the users to ﬁll
in the SUS questionnaire in order to get information about
the usefulness of the SUS questionnaire and its limitations in
this context.

4.2. Data Analysis

The focus group interviews in the ﬁrst case study and
all the other interviews were recorded with a digital voice
recorder and transcribed for further analysis. The tran-
scribed interviews were analysed qualitatively in order to
ﬁnd important themes related to mobile work from them
(content analysis). Each interview was analysed at least
by two researchers. When observing the users, the data

Advances in Human-Computer Interaction

5

was collected by the researchers (by taking notes). The
observations were analysed so that the observed process was
deeply understood: the roles and tasks of the actors, how
they performed their work, which actors were involved in
the process, and so forth. SUS questionnaires were analysed
following its guidelines. We also compared the results of
the questionnaires and the observations in line. After the
data collection phase, the researchers had a group discussion
where the goal was to elicit a common understanding on the
important themes.

5. Results

In this section, we will present the dimensions related to
the success of mobile business services we found in the case
studies. In Section 5.2, we will present the initial version
of the questionnaire for measuring the success of mobile
business services.

5.1. Success Factors Revealed in

the Case Studies

In both of the case studies, we found that the mobile
business service needs to fulﬁll similar usability goals than
other systems. These services need to be eﬀective, eﬃcient,
pleasant, and easy to use to make it easier for the mobile
workers to accept the new service in their daily work. From
the companies’ point of view, improved productivity was
seen as an important success factor. This is also in line with
previous studies (see, e.g., [3, 4, 11]). In both of the cases, the
mobile business service has helped the users in performing
their work more productively. Moreover, when the users
of the services are mobile, safety is the most important
aspect of success. Taxi drivers are driving and construction
workers walking around the construction sites while using
the services. In both of these cases, users need to observe the
environment and minimise their interaction with the service
to avoid accidents.

In addition to the general usability goals, productivity
and safety, we found that learnability is important for the
success of the service. Earlier, Nielsen [14] has emphasised
the role of learnability in usability evaluation. In addition,
Zhang and Adipat [38] as well as Turel [39] have discussed
the importance of learnability in mobile usability. In business
use, severe errors should not happen even when the users are
learning to use the service and learning should not take too
much time. The learning phase may be expensive for both the
company deploying the service (work tasks cannot be done
as eﬃciently as possible) as well as for the service provider.
For the service provider, the costs are due, for example, to
numerous calls to the helpline and extended need for on-site
support.

Before using the safety measurement service, the users
have to install it into their mobile devices. This phase was
found to play a critical role in the success of the service.
If the users did not succeed with installation, they could
easily switch back to using the traditional pen-and-paper
method to perform their work task. For the construction

company, this meant that the beneﬁts of the service were
not achieved. The installation phase was not as critical in the
taxi case, because the taxi drivers did not install the services
themselves. However, it should be noted that installation is
a one-time activity and increasingly automated for the users.
After successful installation, the users are not likely aﬀected
by the possible diﬃculties in the installation process too
much. The most important thing is that the users can get the
service installed.

In the taxi case, one factor having a large eﬀect on the
users’ opinions of the service was the level of support, whether
the users felt that they receive enough support and that
their problems and ideas are heard and acted upon. Support
had also an important role in the construction case where
the users of the mobile safety measurement service needed
additional help while on the move. For example, during
one observation, the user did not know how to answer an
incoming call without distracting the safety measure and at
the end, he needed to start the measurement again. This
resulted in there being two measurements in the system and
the user support needed to combine the two measurements
together.

Moreover, we found that mobile business services need
to take into account issues related to the mobile context.
In previous studies, understanding the context is also seen
essential for the success of mobile service design [8, 40]. In
addition, Kemppil¨a and L¨onnqvist [31] stated that there is a
need to go deeper than just tracking the physical attributes
to be able to understand the eﬀects of the context better.
In analysing the context of work, we need to understand
(1) structure or cues that invites users to enter information
spaces or tasks (entry points), (2) the mental and physical
spaces users are constructing while accomplishing tasks
(action landscapes), and (3) artefacts and environmental
structures that help users manage the complexity of their
tasks (coordinating mechanism) [31].

Exploring the context of work, the environmental context
(including surrounding environment and physical elements
but also organizational factors) sets requirements for the
design of mobile business services. Sometimes, changes in
the context are challenging to manage, for example, sunshine
or coldness when using mobile services. Organizations
provide the work spaces and technology, such as network
connections and devices for their employees. In the taxi
case study, taxi drivers needed to cope with the changing
environmental context and we found that connections were
lost from time to time when changing location, cold weather
slowed down the device, and sunshine made it diﬃcult to
read the screen. In the construction case, lost connection
also distracted the main task, that is, the safety measurement
process and small keys on the mobile phone were diﬃcult
to use, especially in the winter-time with gloves. In addition,
new systems need to be compatible with the old ones.

5.2. Development of a Measurement Tool

In order to develop a proper measurement tool for mobile
business services, we decided to develop an initial version
of questionnaire. A questionnaire as a research method is

6

Advances in Human-Computer Interaction

relatively eﬃcient and cheap. The advantage of a usability
questionnaire, compared to laboratory evaluations, expert
reviews, and checklists usages, is that a questionnaire is
reasonable easy and quick to be carried out and also the
real end users of the product are involved in the process.
The measures made with a questionnaire can be used, for
example, to make comparison of user satisfaction between
diﬀerent versions of the same service or with competing
services (benchmarking).

To begin the development of the questionnaire, we
took an existing questionnaire, SUS, which we tested in
our second case study with construction workers. This
questionnaire is simple and quick to ﬁll in, but unfortunately
its usefulness for the current context was found to be limited
as it does not take into account the mobility of the service
or the business context. For example, the claim “I think that
I would like to use this system frequently” is confusing as
the users must use the mobile service to perform their work
tasks. We also noticed that some of the statements in SUS
were ambiguous as “I found the various functions in this
system were well integrated”.

From the case studies, several success factors were
identiﬁed: eﬀectiveness, eﬃciency, user satisfaction, ease of
use, safety, learnability, ease of installation, support, factors
related to mobile context, and productivity. Eﬀectiveness,
eﬃciency, and user satisfaction are also emphasised in
the ISO standard’s deﬁnition of usability [13]; eﬃciency,
learnability, and satisfaction are emphasised by Nielsen [14],
and ease of use is, for example, part of TAM [19]. In addition,
installation and support (technical manuals and online help)
are part of QUIS [17].

Some of the above-mentioned issues are addressed by
the existing questionnaires (SUMI, QUIS, PSSUQ, SUS,
USE questionnaire, TAM, and MPUQ), but they do not
speciﬁcally focus on the issues that are relevant for the
mobile work context. Thus, we revised the otherwise-
relevant questions from the existing tools to better measure
the success factors that are important for mobile business
services. We also added new dimensions of success, namely,
safety, mobile context, and productivity.

The existing usability measures have been mainly devel-
oped for desktop computers or consumer markets and used
in usability tests. In contrast, the usability measures for
mobile business services must take into account the diﬀerent
contexts of use and the workload the use of the service poses,
among other things. Mobile business services can be used
with diﬀerent devices, such as mobile phones or ﬁxed in-
car systems, and the usability measures need to take into
account the appropriateness of the device to the users’ task.
In addition, the existing tools do not take into account
the fact that the service is typically only part of the story;
the service may fail to support the work task because of
problems in some other parts of the network that is needed
to support the use of the service. The mobile service rarely
acts as an independent tool in the working environment
but information needs to be transferred somewhere. Thus,
it is important that the mobile service and the device enable
fast and easy connection with other devices and users.
To address these issues, the dimension of mobile context

includes questions related to the actual physical context, that
is, mobile device and environment, as well as the overall system
context (see, e.g., [6]).

In the context of consumer services, subjective satisfac-
tion and ease of use are extremely important factors as they
have a large eﬀect on the acceptability and adoption of the
service [20]. In addition, the users of consumer services
often have the freedom of choice—if they do not like the
current service, they can choose another one. In business
context, the end users (workers) often do not have a choice
of not using the system and unfortunately, they often do not
even have a say when the company is deciding on which
service deploy. Despite of that (or rather, because of that),
we feel that subjective satisfaction is important to be taken
into account also in the business context, as it is likely
to have an eﬀect on other measures, such as the overall
work satisfaction and productivity. In order to evaluate the
productivity impacts, we added both direct and indirect
subjective productivity measures under the theme “mobile
work productivity.” In addition, especially the questions
under the themes “eﬃciency” and “eﬀectiveness” are closely
related to productivity.

The statements from the existing questionnaires were
selected based on the themes and their relevance to business
use. The selected statements were modiﬁed so that “mobile
service” and “work tasks” were emphasised. It should be
noted that these themes and questions need to be further
adapted based on the context in which they are applied. For
example, if the service is intended for taxi drivers and used
inside of the vehicles, there is no need to ask if the service
does not do that well in dust or while walking. In addition,
some themes are more relevant in the deployment phase than
in the continued use. For example, ease of installation and
learnability are crucial in the early stages of usage, whereas
the eﬀects on eﬃciency and productivity may be observed
over longer periods of use.

To summarise, we identiﬁed a total of ten diﬀerent
dimensions from our case studies and existing literature
that are likely to have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the success
of mobile services. To meet the demands of measuring the
success factors of mobile business services, we found that
the existing questionnaires are not suﬃcient alone. Thus, the
following factors were added to the repertoire: safety, mobile
context, and impact on mobile work productivity. The list of
dimensions and some examples of the revised and added
statements for the questionnaire on users’ perceived usability
and productivity impacts of the mobile service in work tasks
are listed in Table 1.

The dimensions listed in Table 1 are the ones that we
recognised from the case studies to be important determi-
nants of the success of mobile business services. However,
the dimensions and example items should not be treated
as a ready-to-use questionnaire: the dimensions need to be
prioritised for each case to focus on the most important
aspects of success and more items should possibly be added
to the most important dimensions to capture all the aspects
of them. In its current state, this questionnaire does not
propose a way to collect the ratings from the users. Although
we expect Likert-scales to be a useful way to collect ratings,

6. Discussion

Previous research on usability measurement
tools has
focused mostly on desktop environments. Usability is a
critical issue in any service, but when poor usability may
aﬀect the security of the mobile users (and their customers)
or the productivity of their work, the issue becomes even
more important. In addition, when usability may aﬀect not
only the business operations of the company who produced
the service but also the companies deploying it, the business
impact of usability may be noticeably large. Thus, when
considering the success of mobile business services, we claim
that usability, context of work, and productivity must be
taken into account. Thus far, measuring the success of mobile
business services has received little attention. There are sev-

eral independent measurement tools for usability designers
and business managers. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the ﬁrst attempt to combine the dimensions of usability
and productivity into a single measurement tool for mobile
business services.

In this paper, we identiﬁed ten success factors of mobile
business services through two case studies by combining
the approaches of usability and productivity measurement.
These success factors include the ease of installation, learn-
ability, ease of use, eﬃciency, eﬀectiveness, user satisfaction,
factors related to mobile context, safety, support, and mobile
work productivity. Most of these factors are included in the
current tools for usability measurement. Thus, the existing
usability questionnaires were used as the basis for the current
tool although they needed to be revised for the current
purposes. In addition, themes needed to be added to capture
all the important factors in relation to the success of mobile
business services, such as the issues related to the mobile

device, environment, and the overall system, as well as safety,
support, and mobile work productivity.

We expect the results of the questionnaire to be useful, for
example, in analysing and benchmarking the level in which
the users of the service perceive the usability and productivity
of the service to be. Moreover, by reusing the questionnaire,
results may be used for detecting changes, for example, in
satisfaction and productivity over time. The results not only
help the service developers in developing more successful
services, but they can also be useful for the company using
the service. For example, information about the level of
perceived productivity and problems related to productivity
in mobile work can be used as diagnostic tools to improve
the productivity over time.

In this paper, we are proposing that a questionnaire
could be used to measure the success of mobile business
services. We acknowledge the limitations of
the ques-
tionnaire approach (it measures the users’ perception of
things rather than the objective truth, users may have
diﬃculties interpreting the questions)—but we claim that
the beneﬁts of this approach overweight the limitations:
questionnaire is a fast data-collection method, it can address
several diﬀerent themes, and it can provide quantiﬁable
information about the themes in question. However, we
do not claim that questionnaire (or any other single
data collection method) should be used alone. Objective
performance data (task time, customers/day, or revenue)
should naturally be used as indicators of success as well.
However, relying only on sales or objective eﬃciency may
result in the less successful parts of the service going
unnoticed—and potential for further development not being
realised.

In our two-year MOMENTO project, the next step is
to test the suggested themes and items of the questionnaire
in several case studies. In addition to making sure that the
dimensions are suﬃcient and applicable to diﬀerent domains
where mobile business services are used, we will address
the issues related to the success of the individual items, the
optimal number of items per dimension, and the scoring of
the questionnaires. In addition, the validity and reliability of
the questionnaire will be evaluated (see, e.g., [41]).

In this paper, we have mainly addressed the success
factors from a single worker’s viewpoint. Other themes that
emerged in the case studies were related to measuring success
factors at the organizational level and in a more objective
manner. These issues will be explored and identiﬁed in more
detail in our future work.
