ABSTRACT
The World Wide Web (Web) is changing. The much vaunted
Web 2.0 sees once static pages evolving into hybrid appli-
cations. Content that was once simple is now becoming
increasingly complicated due to the many updating compo-
nents located throughout the page. The information over-
load and visual complexity of such components is signiﬁ-
cant. This increased complexity can produce lower perfor-
mance and higher levels of stress and frustration which neg-
atively eﬀect the user.
In previous work we have shown
how galvanic skin response (GSR) measurements, collected
in tandem with eye-tracking data, can be used as a method
for determining how stressed users become when interact-
ing with content. The results of that study demonstrated
that when used appropriately, the presence of Web 2.0 con-
tent can reduce GSR measurements and be of beneﬁt to
users. In this work, the previous study was repeated with
twenty-three older Web users to establish if similar patterns
of interaction could be established. The results reveal that
while older participants made use of dynamic content, unlike
previous participants, they were a non-homogenous group
with a large variance in the GSR measurements. We assert
that a cause of this is hesitancy and therefore developing
techniques to reduce hesitancy will beneﬁt older users when
interacting with Web 2.0 content.

INTRODUCTION

The Web is undergoing a profound change. The much
vaunted Web 2.0 sees pages that were once static docu-
ments evolve into composite applications created from mul-
tiple third party sources delivering dynamically changing in-
formation streams [9]. Content that was simple to browse is
now becoming increasingly complicated due to the many up-
dating components located throughout the page [19]. Web-
sites such as Flickr1 and Facebook2 all rely on these new
components and are all popular with users. However, prob-
lems arise due to the increased interface complexity of this
new Web model with changes in content, context, and mul-
tiple dynamic updates, built from “mashed-up” information
streams, all competing for the user’s attention [25]. The
shift in the way the Web works comes with a corresponding
increase in the cognitive load required to understand and
interact with it [23]. This additional load can produce lower
performance and higher levels of stress and frustration which
negatively eﬀect both work and social activity.

Without a full understanding of the interaction of users
with Web 2.0 technologies the Web may rapidly become un-
able to support their interaction needs. Only by a deep
understanding of this interaction can we propose solutions
to improve the user’s experience of interacting with Web
content. However, in order to develop a full understanding
of the areas of the page that cause the user most frustration,
there is a need to capture the stress levels of the participant
in order to determine where the cause of the frustration lies.
In a previous study [6], twenty-one younger participants
completed six Web-based tasks while a GSR device captured
their stress levels. Results showed that when dynamic con-
tent, in the form of auto-suggest lists (ASL), was disabled
users became more error prone and their stress levels rose.
This paper describes an extension to the previous study by
repeating the same tasks with twenty-three older Web users.
The results reveal that while older participants made use of
dynamic content, unlike previous participants, older users
were a non-homogenous group with a large variance in the
GSR measurements that were obtained. We assert that a
cause of this variance is hesitancy, which is discussed fur-
ther in Section 5. Therefore developing techniques to reduce
hesitancy as users make use of dynamic content will be of
beneﬁt to older users when interacting with Web 2.0 pages.

2. BACKGROUND

The Web is undergoing a profound change. Once static
documents have evolved into composite applications created
from multiple third party sources delivering dynamically
changing information streams. When users are faced with
multiple types of content, they have diﬃculty in dividing
their attention between the elements to complete tasks ef-
fectively [19]. This additional load is a major problem for an
ageing population of knowledge workers expected to work
longer into old age. The general eﬀects of ageing include
changes in attention, cognition and behaviour, all of which
aﬀect how people use the Web. Studies have shown that el-
derly Web users experience a heightened cautiousness and a
hesitancy about making responses that may be incorrect [4,
8]. In addition, elderly users show diﬃculty in maintaining
attention, focus and concentration on tasks where there is a
lot of distracting information [2]. In noisy information en-
vironments this hesitancy produces lower performance and
higher levels of stress and frustration that negatively eﬀects
both work and social activity. There is therefore a need to
determine which areas of dynamic content are attracting an
older user’s attention and how they cope with that content
when faced with multiple information sources.

2.1 Eye Tracking

One approach that has been applied to improve the usabil-
ity of Web pages is eye-tracking. Eye-tracking allows users’
eye movements to be captured and analysed to understand
how users perceive the Web page or application interface.
The eye-tracker records the pattern of ﬁxations on a Web
page, enabling one to determine those areas that attract the
most ﬁxations, and those that receive little attention [21].
Eye-tracking can even be used to gauge the diﬃculty of a
task that the user is being asked to perform through a mea-
surement of the saccade length [13]. Pan et al. [14] found
that, with the exception of search tasks, the second page
users viewed of the Website had a higher saccade rate than
the ﬁrst page. As saccade rate is negatively correlated to
task diﬃculty, this implied that the second page required
less cognitive eﬀort from the user as they knew what to
expect from the page and where to ﬁnd key elements. As
search results typically have a diﬀerent style for their second
page, this could explain the increased cognitive load.

Eye-tracking’s most obvious application is in improving
the standard design and layout of Web pages, and evalu-
ating their usability [18]. Jay et al. [3] demonstrated that
the layout and presentation of a Web page can assist users
as they interact with the Website. The study tracked users’
eye movements as they interacted with the text-only version
of a news Website and the standard version. Users made
signiﬁcantly more eye ﬁxations on the text-only version sug-
gesting that the text-only page required more of the user’s
attention to process the content. Studies have also examined
the saliency of items on a page under varying conditions [1,
17], how eye movements vary according to cues in the in-
formation environment that enable a user to estimate how
much useful information they are likely to get on a given
path [16] and how looking for a menu is inﬂuenced by page
complexity and prior expectations [7].

2.2 Galvanic Skin Response

While eye-tracking can identify the areas of the page that
attract the users attention, it can not determine how users

are coping with the multiple areas of content vying for their
attention. One approach that can help understand how a
user reacts to events is to use galvanic skin response mea-
surements (GSR). GSR is a physiological indicator of psy-
chological events that involves measuring the drop in resis-
tance to an electrical current passed through the skin [10].
Electrodes are usually placed on an appropriate area of the
hand or foot. This is because sweat glands in these areas
are more inﬂuenced by mental stimulus than by tempera-
ture. Resistance is changed due to increased sweat gland
activity, with increased sweat increasing resistance.

The main application of GSR is in the ﬁeld of biofeed-
back. This is an approach whereby participants have their
GSR measurements taken and receive various audio or visual
stimuli that provide feedback on whether the values are in-
creasing or decreasing [12]. With training, participants may
learn how to alter their automatic responses to stimuli. With
enough repetition new habit patterns may be established
that allow participants to manage any psychophysiological
symptoms that they may be suﬀering from [22]. While GSR
is predominantly used in biofeedback, there have also been
studies using GSR to determine the stress levels of people
placed in highly tense situations. Perala and Sterling [15]
conducted a study with military personal to measure stress
levels due to the use of new equipment. As GSR was not a
well established technique, studies were conducted alongside
traditional interviews and questionnaire techniques and sali-
vary amylase testing, a method that measures stress levels
through saliva. Results demonstrated that there was a cor-
relation between the results of the three methods and that
GSR was a useful technique.

To the authors’ knowledge GSR measurements have only
been used in conjunction with Web page analysis in very
limited trials. Mooney et al. [11], for example, noted that
users exhibited measurable GSR responses when watching
videos and performing an image-based search task. That
study, however, focused on information retrieval tasks yet,
as discussed previously, Web 2.0 pages typically have multi-
ple dynamic areas of content vying for the user’s attention.
Therefore there is still a need to determine how the content
of a Web page can eﬀect the stress levels of users.

While there have been a number of critiques over the use
of physiological measures in HCI [24], these have centred
around the ability to identify that something has occurred
but not being able to say what. The additional use of eye-
tracking in our studies allows for the identiﬁcation of what
the user was doing when a response was invoked. Ward and
Marsden [24] also observed that GSR measurements across
users were inconsistent and unique to an indivividual. While
we acknowledge that this is a valid criticism, we are not
attempting to create a general model of GSR patterns for
diﬀerent age groups of Web users.
Instead we propose to
use the GSR patterns to identify what, if anything, caused
individual participants to react to a particular Website. By
identifying areas that could potential cause negative reac-
tion, solutions can be developed to assist users, if they so
wish, to enable the Web to be a more enjoyable experience.

3. METHOD

This study was a repeat of previous work [6] but with the
participant set extended to include older users. Therefore
the tasks and analysis methods used were the same as that
study. The tasks were designed to understand how people

allocated their attention to Web 2.0 content and if using
that content increased the participants level of stress and
frustration. The aim of the study was to identify if age
could be used to determine the stress levels of participants
when interacting with dynamic content. The assertion be-
ing that in general, older users would ﬁnd dynamic content
more stressful than the younger users who took part in the
previous study. In addition, we also sought to establish if
diﬀerences in stress levels could be identiﬁed within tasks,
where a speciﬁc type of dynamic content had been enabled
or disabled.

3.1 Participants

Twenty-three participants were recruited to take part in
the study, grouped into age bands of 30 – 49 (mean = 40.88,
standard deviation = 7.40); 50 – 59 (mean = 52.00, stan-
dard deviation = 2.33); and 60 – 69 (mean = 62.57, standard
deviation = 2.57). Participants were recruited from the Uni-
versity of Manchester Alumni Association. The Alumni As-
sociation sends quarterly newsletters to alumni of the Uni-
versity, into which an advertisement was placed. The study
took approximately 10 minutes to complete, with partici-
pants being given £10 for their time and eﬀorts. Twenty-
two of the participants stated that they used the Web daily,
and one participant reported that they used the Web at
least once a week. Therefore all participants were familiar
with the Web and how to use and interact with Web con-
tent. A summary of demographic data for the participants
is provided in Table 1.

3.2 Equipment

Participants sat in front of a 17” monitor with a built in
TOBII 1750 eye-tracker. The page data and eye movements
were recorded on a Sony VAIO laptop. TOBII Studio Pro-
fessional eye gaze analysis software was used to record and
analyse the eye-tracking data. In addition, participants’ ﬁn-
gers were attached to a MindWalker 3 biofeedback meter
using Velcro ﬁnger straps. MindWalker 3 software was used
to record the GSR data.

3.3 Tasks and Stimuli

The tasks investigated how diﬀerent age groups interacted
with dynamic Web content by asking people to complete
short directed tasks. In total there were six tasks, with each
task designed to prompt interaction with an element that
may or may not contain dynamic information. For instance
the two “search” tasks contained no dynamic information,
but the two “suggest” tasks provided an auto-suggest list
(ASL) that dynamically appeared as participants typed in
order to assist users with achieving their goal.

The “search” and “suggest” tasks required users to look
for speciﬁc information. For the two “portal” pages, the

tasks were more vague in order to allow users to interact
with the page more naturally. Users were asked to identify
a news story that they found of interest, which is more akin
to browsing, rather than being asked to locate a speciﬁc
news story, which could have been more easily completed
using a search box.

The aim of the study was to gather data about how people
perceive and use this dynamic content and if the presence
of such content increases or reduces user stress levels. In all
cases, interaction was documented with the live Websites
as this was necessary for the dynamic features to function.
For Google Search, Google Suggest, National Rail Enquiries
Search and National Rail Enquiries Suggest, the front page
was cached to a local server to enable the ASLs to be en-
abled / disabled as the task required. However the search
results and ASLs were pulled from the live Website. Partic-
ipants were asked to complete the following tasks:

3.3.1 Google Search

For this task, users were asked: “Search for the University
of Manchester”. This was the standard Google Search page
but with ASLs disabled. Most users would be familiar with
searching for information using a search engine. This there-
fore provided a base-case for which to compare the assisted
ASL version.

3.3.2 Google Suggest

For this task, users were asked: “Search for the University
of Manchester”. This page provided suggestions to the user
as they typed words into the search box via an ASL that
appeared just below the text entry form. The page used in
this task was identical to the Google Search page except for
the presence of the ASL. This was to allow for a comparison
between to the two versions of the page so as to establish
if users found the ASLs useful, if ASLs were ignored by
the user or if ASLs were a hindrance to the user as they
completed their task.

3.3.3 National Rail Search

For this task, users were asked: “Search for a train for
one person from Manchester to London”. This was a search
task similar to Google, however the inputs were more con-
strained. With the Google tasks, variations were more ac-
ceptable. For example “Manchester University”, “Univer-
sity of Manchester” and “The University of Manchester”
would all yield similar results. However, with the railway
search, users were constrained to very speciﬁc keywords that
represented the names of train stations i.e. “Manchester”
and “London”. The aim of the task was to see if constrain-
ing the user’s input would be of beneﬁt to the participants
and help them achieve their goal more eﬀectively, or if con-
straining the valid inputs would be a hindrance and eﬀect
their stress level.

3.3.4 National Rail Suggest

For this task, users were asked: “Search for a train for
one person from Manchester to London”. This page pro-
vided suggestions to the user as they typed words into the
search box via an ASL that appeared just below the text
entry forms. The page used in this task was identical to
the National Rail Search page except for the presence of the
ASLs. This was to allow for a comparison between the two
versions of the page so as to establish if users found the ASLs

useful, if ASLs were ignored by the user or if ASLs were a
hindrance to the user as they completed their task. Unlike
the Google Suggest ASL, the set of possible searches was
restrained to the stations that existed within the UK and
was therefore more accurate as there was a limited choice to
present.

3.3.5 iGoogle

For this task, users were asked: “Take a look at the news
stories in the CNN.com box. Would you be interested in
reading any of these further?” This task was akin to brows-
ing as users were not given a directed task to achieve. In-
stead they were asked to look around for a news story that
they may be interested in reading further. For this task,
there were two areas of interest. The ﬁrst was to see if users
spotted the expansion boxes, located next to the news sto-
ries, that provided further details of the article before they
made a decision. The second was to see if users noticed
and interacted with any of the other dynamic content that
existed on the page. The four search tasks were limited to
zero or one element of dynamic content on the page. The
iGoogle task contained multiple areas of micro-content that
updated independently of each other and the user. This task
could therefore establish if the large number of information
sources distracted users and increased their GSR measure-
ment levels.

3.3.6 Yahoo!

For this task, users were asked: “Take a look at the news,
sports or entertainment stories. Would you be interested
in reading any of these further?” This was similar to the
iGoogle task and again had two areas of interest. The ﬁrst
was to see if users spotted the tabs that allowed users to
access the diﬀerent categories of news stories before they
made their decision. As with the iGoogle task, the second
area of interest for this task was to see if the large number
of information sources present on the page distracted users
and increased their GSR measurement levels.

3.4 Procedure

Participants read the information sheet and sat in front
of the eye-tracker, which was calibrated to their eyes. The
ﬁnger straps of the GSR device were attached to the partic-
ipant’s index and middle ﬁngers. This was typically the left
hand so that users could use the mouse without hindrance.
However, for left-handed users the ﬁnger straps were at-
tached to the participant’s right index and middle ﬁngers.

Participants started the experiment on an index page that
contained links to the six Websites that were used as stim-
uli in the experiment. Participants visited the Websites in a
random order, however all tasks were completed by the par-
ticipants. After the participant had completed the tasks,
they were asked to ﬁll in a short questionnaire to gather
information such as age, gender, and whether they were fa-
miliar with the sites that they had been asked to perform
tasks on. To validate the results of the evaluation, the entire
session was recorded using an audio tape recorder.

4. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

Before analysis could commence, the data was sampled so
that it represented GSR measurements captured every tenth
of a second. This made the analysis more manageable with-
out adversely eﬀecting the quality of the graph. In addition,

the captured GSR graph was ﬁltered using a Savitzky-Golay
smoothing ﬁlter [20]. This technique smoothed the graph by
removing noise but preserved the main features of the GSR
distribution, such as the maximum, minimum, and width.

With the data cleaned, two analyses were conducted. The
ﬁrst was to identify what the user was doing when a peak
occurred within the GSR graph. This was conducted on
all tasks and achieved through annotating the graphs with
the aid of the data captured by the eye-tracker. The data
for two participants was not included in the study as the
GSR device failed to capture data for one participant (P21)
and the eye-tracker failed to capture data for one participant
(P3). A Full set of annotated graphs for the 21 valid datasets
can be found in [5].

The Google tasks and National Rail tasks were designed
to ensure only one element of dynamic content was either
present or absent in the page. These results were therefore
analysed together as a comparison could be made between
the results of the pages as there was only one variable. The
iGoogle and Yahoo! tasks however, contained diﬀerent con-
tent and layout as they were designed to establish if multiple
sources of dynamic content distracted the user and increased
their stress levels. As a result, no direct comparison between
the relative stressfulness of the tasks is made due to the
large number of confounding variables that were present in
the pages when the tasks were completed. To compare the
Google tasks and National Rail tasks, the number of peaks
that occurred within the graph were counted. This allowed
for a comparison to be made between tasks to establish the
relative stress level of users when they were completing the
tasks. For a full discussion of the analysis techniques, read-
ers are directed to [6]. The results of analysing the data are
provided below.

4.1 Google Search And Suggest

By analysing the GSR graphs of the participants in this
study, seven areas of interest could be identiﬁed that caused
peaks in the GSR measurements for the participants during
the Google tasks. To be classed as an area of interest, a peak
had to occur at least once when at least one participant was
looking at that area. These areas of interest are shown in
Figure 1.

In the previous study [6], younger users followed a simi-
lar pattern of interaction when performing both the Google
Search and Google Suggest tasks. The results of analysing
the peak counts shown that there was signiﬁcantly less stress
when users interacted with the ASL enabled version of the
page as they anticipated the ASL to appear. When it did
not, they found this frustrating and more stressful. For the
older users in this study, this was not the case and regular
patterns of interaction could not be identiﬁed from the GSR
graphs for the Google tasks. Consider Figure 2 for example,
taken from a participant from the 30 – 49 age group. The
graph shows a user performing the Google Search task. A
peak can be seen when the user started to type the search
terms into the Google Search box. However, the participant
did not look at the page, instead they focused on the key-
board until they pressed the return key to start the search,
although the GSR graphs shows a number of peaks as they
user was typing. This may have been as the user pressed a
key or due to the stress of performing the task.

However, consider Figure 3 which shows an example Google
Suggest GSR graph from a participant from the 50 – 59 age

Figure 1: Areas of interest identiﬁed from comb-
ing the GSR graphs and eye-tracking data for the
Google pages.

group. During this task the user glanced around the page
as they typed. In this task the participant did look up from
the keyboard and saw the ASL that appeared but ignored
it. Instead, the participant corrected an error and chose to
type the search terms in manually. While they were typing,
a large number of peaks were recorded but as the user was
looking at the keyboard, it was not possible to identify why
this happened.

For the 50 – 59 age group, again no regular patterns of
interaction could be identiﬁed as users tended to interact
with the page in diﬀerent ways. For example, four users
did not use the ASL when it appeared on the screen and
instead completed the search terms manually. In addition,
this group of participants tended to be more cautious with
the search terms. Four participants clicked the “pages from
the UK” radio button on the Google page, indicated as 7(cid:13) in
Figure 1, to ensure that they received results from the UK.
This behaviour had not happened in the previous study or
with the 30 – 49 age group. In addition, this group also made
spelling errors when typing terms into the search boxes of
the Google tasks. Only one participant in the 30 – 49 age
group made a typing error but with the 50 – 59 age group six

spond to areas deﬁned in Figure 1.

participants made errors when performing the task. For the
purposes of this study an error is deﬁned to be a spelling mis-
take that was corrected by the user in either of the Google
tasks.

As with the previous two groups, the 60 – 69 age group did
not consistently interact with the Google task pages. Two
participants did not look at the screen as they were typing
in search terms, but the remaining ﬁve frequently glanced
between the keyboard and screen. As with the 50 – 59 age
group, two participants clicked the “pages from the UK”
radio button on the Google page to ensure that they got
results from the UK. Again there were errors made when
entering data into the search boxes, with two participants
making mistakes that they then rectiﬁed later during the
task.

Figure 4 shows a comparison of the peak counts for both
the Google Search and Google Suggest tasks for all users,
including the younger users from the previous study. A sum-
mary is provided in Table 2. For the ≤ 29 age group, the
results show that users were less stressed when interacting
with the Google Suggest task (mean = 6.32, standard de-
viation = 5.30) than they were for the Google Search task
(mean = 10.95, standard deviation = 6.50). Analysing the
results with a t-test, also shown in Table 2, gave a value of
t(18) = 4.29, with p = 0.0004. As p < 0.05, the result was

signiﬁcant. However, for the older age groups, there was no
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two Google tasks.

For the Google tasks, a comparison between all age groups
was made using a one-way ANOVA analysis. For the Google
Search task F (3, 37) = 1.648, M SE = 73.834, p = 0.195.
As p ≥ 0.05 the result was not signiﬁcant suggesting that
age was not a signiﬁcant factor in the mean stress levels of
the participants. For the Google Suggest task F (3, 37) =
0.285, M SE = 11.003, p = 0.839. As p ≥ 0.05 the result
was not signiﬁcant suggesting that age was not a signiﬁcant
factor in the mean stress levels of the participants.

4.2 National Rail Search and Suggest

By analysing the GSR graphs of the participants in this
study, sixteen areas of interest could be identiﬁed that caused
peaks in the GSR measurements for the participants during
the National Rail tasks. To be classed as an area of interest,
a peak had to occur at least once when at least one par-
ticipant was looking at that area. The areas of interest for
National Rail are shown in Figure 5.

In the previous study [6], younger users tended not to fol-
low similar patterns of interaction when performing both the
National Rail Search and National Rail Suggest tasks. How-
ever, there was a preference for the National Rail Suggest
task as users found the presence of the ASL useful. The
results of analysing the peak counts show that there was
signiﬁcantly less stress when users interacted with the ASL
enabled version of the page as they anticipated the ASL to
appear. When it did not, they found this frustrating and
more stressful.

For the participants of the 30 – 49 age group and 50 – 59

age group in this study, this was not the case as participants
followed a similar pattern of interaction for the National
Rail Search tasks. Figure 6 shows a typical GSR graph for
a participant performing the National Rail Search task. As
can be seen, participants would typically look round the
page, then type and glance at the search boxes into which
they were entering the station names. For this task, one
participant from the 30 – 49 age group made a typing error.
For the 50 – 59 age group, four participants made errors.
Three made typing mistakes that had to be rectiﬁed during
the task. One participant pressed the wrong button and so
did not search for the train time tables but instead searched
for ‘content on the Website in general’‘Live Departures and
Arrives’, indicated as 14(cid:13) in Figure 5.

A similar pattern of interaction also occurred with the
National Rail Suggest tasks. Figure 7 shows a typical GSR
graph for a participant performing this task. As with Na-
tional Rail Search, participants would typically look round
the page, then type and glance at the search boxes into
which they were entering the station names. When the ASL
appeared they would make the choice before moving to the
next text entry ﬁeld. For the 30 – 49 age group, only one
participant did not make use of the ASL feature and unlike
the previous tasks, no errors were made when entering text.
The same was also true for the 50 – 59 age group.

For the 60 – 69 age group no single pattern of interac-

Some users
looked around the page before typing, but did not glance
at the screen as they typed. However some participants did
glance at the page as they were typing. In particular, some
participants would enter text in the ﬁrst text-tentry box
and then spend time looking at the page. This interaction
occurred with ﬁve participants. One possible reason was be-
cause there was so many elements on the page, users wanted
to ensure that no additional tasks had to be performed be-
fore they could commence their search.

For the National Rail Suggest tasks, again no one pattern
of interaction could be established for the 60 – 69 age group.
As with National Rail Search, some participants would look
round the page, then type and glance at the search boxes
into which they were entering the station names. When the
ASL appeared they would make the choice before moving
to the next text entry ﬁeld. However, what was interesting
was that with four participants, errors were introduced be-
fore selecting a choice from the ASL, causing the ASL to
disappear. The participants then had to correct their mis-
take before the ASL reappeared and a choice could be made
from the selection. As with the National Rail Search task,
three participants also spent time looking at the page after
entering text into both search boxes. Again this could be
due to the page having a large number of elements contained
within it.

Figure 8 shows a comparison of the peak counts for both
the National Rail Search and National Rail Suggest tasks
for all users, including the younger users from the previous
study. A summary is provided in Table 3. For the ≤ 29 age
group, the results show that users were less stressed when
interacting with the National Rail Suggest task (mean =
11.895, standard deviation = 7.945) than they were for the
National Rail Search task (mean = 9.845, standard deviation
= 11.895). Analysing the results with a t-test, also shown
in Table 3, gave a value of t(18) = 2.322, with p = 0.032.
As p < 0.05, the result was signiﬁcant. For the 30 – 49
age group and 60 – 69 age group there was no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between the two National Rail tasks. However,
for the 50 – 59 age group, the results show that users were
less stressed when interacting with the National Suggest task
(mean = 10.000, standard deviation = 6.377) than they were
for the National Rail Search task (mean = 16.714, standard
deviation = 12.567). Analysing the results with a t-test,

also shown in Table 3, gave a value of t(6) = 2.723, with p =
0.035. As p < 0.05, the result was signiﬁcant. One reason for
this group being less stressed with the Suggest task may be
because they gained most beneﬁt from the ASLs. During
the National Rail Search task, four participants from the
50 – 59 age group made errors however no errors were made
during the National Rail Suggest task.

For the National Rail tasks, a comparison between all age
groups was made using a one-way ANOVA analysis. For
the National Rail Search task F (3, 37) = 1.256, M SE =
115.053, p = 0.304. As p ≥ 0.05 the result was not signiﬁ-
cant suggesting that age was not a signiﬁcant factor in the
mean stress levels of the participants. For the National Rail
Suggest task F (3, 37) = 1.323, M SE = 151.955, p = 0.281.
As p ≥ 0.05 the result was not signiﬁcant suggesting that
age was not a signiﬁcant factor in the mean stress levels of
the participants.

4.3 iGoogle and Yahoo!

The iGoogle and Yahoo! tasks were similar to browsing
as the participants were asked to look around the page and
ﬁnd a news story that was of interest to them. While the
task directed participants to a particular news source, as
the pages had multiple news sources, providing an answer
from any of these sources was suﬃcient to complete the task.
The purpose of the task was to establish if the competing
areas of micro-content distracted the users as they looked
around the page and caused a change in the participants’
GSR measurements. Unlike previous tasks, no comparison
was made between the relative stress levels of these pages
as both contained diﬀerent content with diﬀerent methods
of interaction. Therefore the high number of confounding
variables made a like-for-like comparison diﬃcult.

For all age groups, there were typically two varieties of
participants producing two similar shaped GSR graphs for

ring in the GSR data for the National Rail Search
and National Rail Suggest tasks.

the iGoogle and Yahoo!
tasks. The ﬁrst type of partici-
pant were those who ﬁxated on the news stories relatively
quickly and ignored the remaining content on the page. As
this task had no speciﬁc outcome, the participants were un-
der less pressure and so the GSR graphs of these participants
tended to be gentle slopes with no major peaks or toughs.
Figure 9 shows a typical example of this user group for the
iGoogle task. The participant scanned the page with brief
glances to gain an overview of the content. When the partic-
ipant had found the news stories, the graph dropped until
a choice had been made.
It was interesting to note that
some participants did not notice the news stories required
to complete the task but found alternative news sources in-
stead. This happened to two participants in the 30 – 49 age
group, with one participant ﬁnding a link to the BBC news
section of the Website and selecting stories from that. Four
participants from the 50 – 59 age group found alternative
news stories rather than those suggested as part of the task.
Few participants used the Web 2.0 features in the portal
tasks. The iGoogle news stories had an expansion tab to
allow users to read more information about the headline,
but no participants made use of this feature. The Yahoo!
news section had tabs that allowed users to access diﬀerent
areas of news stories. No participants from the 30 – 49 age
group made use of this feature; two participants from the
50 – 59 age group used the tabs and three participants from
the 60 – 69 age group made use of the tab features to access

Figure 11: The number of peaks occurring in the
GSR data for the iGoogle task.

the news stories.

The second type of participant were those that seemed
to be distracted by all the small areas of micro-content.
Figure 10 shows a typical example of this user group for
the Yahoo! portal. Throughout the task the participant
was looking at various elements on the page. Even when
the news stories had been identiﬁed, the participant still
looked around the page at diﬀerent elements on the screen.
For the iGoogle task, some users were similarly distracted.
The iGoogle page contained boxes such as Wikipedia and a
YouTube video of the day element. Due to network latency,
these elements loaded slightly later than the other content
on the page. A number of users reacted strongly to these
elements, which usually manifested itself as a peak on the
graph when the YouTube video loaded, but with no corre-
sponding eye-tracking scan path as the user was not looking
directly at that section of the page. This occurred with two
users in the 30 – 49 age group and three participants from
the 50 – 59 age group.

Figure 11 shows a comparison of the peak counts for the
iGoogle task including the younger users from the previous
study. A comparison between all age groups was made using
a one-way ANOVA analysis. For the iGoogle task F (3, 37) =
0.542, M SE = 34.632, p = 0.657. As p ≥ 0.05 the result
was not signiﬁcant suggesting that age was not a signiﬁcant
factor in the mean stress levels of the participants. Figure 12
shows a comparison of the peak counts for the Yahoo! task
including the younger users from the previous study. For the
Yahoo! task F (3, 37) = 1.989, M SE = 113.799, p = 0.132.
As p ≥ 0.05 the result was not signiﬁcant suggesting that
age was not a signiﬁcant factor in the mean stress levels of
the participants.

5. DISCUSSION

The study presented in this paper had two aims. The
ﬁrst was to extend previous work to establish a diﬀerence
between younger users of Web 2.0 content and older users of
Web 2.0 content. However, for all six tasks that were con-
ducted as part of the study, ANOVA analysis demonstrated
that age grouping made no signiﬁcant diﬀerence to the mean
stress levels of the participants.

The second aim was to identify a diﬀerence in stress lev-
els between tasks where Web 2.0 content had been disabled
and enabled to establish if the presence or absence of small
amounts of Web 2.0 content aided or hindered users. Re-

a diﬀerence in the GSR graphs generated by the younger
users when ASL content was disabled on a page. For both
the Google and the National Rail tasks, the page where the
ASL was enabled resulted in signiﬁcantly less peaks in the
GSR readings from the participants than for the version
of the page where the ASL was disabled. This suggested
that users expected the dynamic content to appear and that
it aided them in their tasks. However, for the older users
groups that took part in this study, there was no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between the tasks. While the results are not as
expected, they do reveal a number of factors that may have
contributed to the diﬀerences between the two groups of
users that will be of use in future work, which are discussed
further below.

5.1 Computer Familiarity

One factor is the familiarity of computers by the users.
The participants from the original study were all familiar
with the Web and had prior expectations of how they ex-
pected functionality to operate. For example the Google
Search and Google Suggest tasks revealed that users looked
at the areas of the page where they believed an auto-suggest
list would be present. On the search task, where the ASL
was disabled, participants continued to look for the ASL
which resulted in a larger number of psychophysiological re-
sponses. Even though all the older users in this study used
the Web regularly, they seemed to have less exceptions of
what the functionality of the page should consist oﬀ. They
approached each task with the same tentativeness and so
subtly changing the functionality, such as the disabling of
an ASL did not create as large a surprise as for the younger
users and therefore did not cause a consistent increase in
stress.

5.2 Cautiousness Towards Computers

Being cautious in an approach to the page does not nec-
essarily mean that older users did not know how to interact
with the Web 2.0 content. There were older users who made
use of the ASLs when they appeared and made use of the
Yahoo! tabs to read all the news stories during the Yahoo!
portal task. However, this cautious attitude towards com-
puters in general may be a second factor why the results of
the GSR were less clear for the older user groups than the
younger group from the original study. The younger users
did not care about making mistakes and appeared to be of
the view that it did not matter if something went wrong.
Indeed, six younger participants made typing mistakes dur-
ing the Google Search task and ﬁve made errors during the
Google Suggest task. However, they did not seem eﬀected
by the errors and assumed Google would be able to calculate
their intent and provide the search results that were required
for the task. Only one participant commented on their typ-
ing error, but lay blame on the computer by saying to the
evaluator “That’s not me. It’s the keyboard”. This was an
interesting statement as it highlighted the fact that younger
users see computers as tools to be used and it is not the fault
of the user when unintended events happen. However, the
older users seemed to take the opposite opinion and blame
themselves when an error occurred. For example, one user
stated “Oh no. Look at that” when an error occurred and
a number of users apologised for making errors. An inter-
esting aspect of this is that all-but-one of the users in this

study used the Web daily and therefore were familiar with
its functionality. As mentioned previously, many older users
made use of the Web 2.0 functionality so it was not a lack
of awareness that aﬀected the participant’s attitude but a
level of uncertainty of what to expect.

5.3 Different Range of Abilities

The ﬁnal factor is the variance of ability within the older
age groups. The younger participants in the previous study
all behaved in similar ways. They completed the tasks with-
out many questions or comments and a majority of partic-
ipants completed tasks in similar ways. However the older
users had a more diverse range of abilities, skills and atti-
tudes that became apparent when completing tasks. This is
revealed in the broad spread of results for the peak counts
of the Google and National Rail tasks for all groups and
the inability to ﬁnd regular patterns of how users interacted
with the tasks that were set.

While this study has been broad and used only a small
sample of users, it has provided useful insights that can be
used for future work in assisting older Web users to access
Web 2.0 content. While some of the users in the study were
comfortable when interacting with Web 2.0 content, there
were others who were not aware of what to expect. There
were also signs of hesitancy and uncertainty when complet-
ing the tasks. Therefore informing users of what type of
content is on the page and how this content operates will be
of beneﬁt to some members of the older age groups. How-
ever, as we have seen, the older age groups have a more var-
ied interaction pattern, unlike the younger group. Therefore
one should not assume that one size ﬁts all. Any support
that is provided will need to only be available when the user
requires it. Some participants were comfortable using Web
2.0 content where as other users were not. Providing assis-
tance when users do not require it will be frustrating and
negate any beneﬁts that the tool may bring.

6. CONCLUSION

As the Web continues to evolve from a collection of static
documents into an interactive stream of multiple informa-
tion sources, there will be a corresponding increase in cogni-
tive load placed on users. In previous work, we have demon-
strated that the use of GSR measurements is a valid ap-
proach to identifying when users become stressed and frus-
trated while interacting with Web 2.0 content. In this paper,
an extension to the previous study has been presented that
repeated the same task with twenty-three older Web users.
The results show that age was not a determining factor for
identifying how stressed users became when interacting with
Web 2.0 content. In addition, unlike previous participants,
there was a large variance within the results for the older
user groups with no consistent patterns of interaction iden-
tiﬁable from the GSR graphs. There was also signs from
some users of hesitancy and uncertainty when completing
the tasks.

Using these ﬁndings as a basis, we are now in the process
of developing a tool to assist older users as they interact
with Web 2.0 content. To aid with hesitancy and uncer-
tainty when completing the tasks, we envisage a helper that
will explain to users how the dynamic content operates and
how users can interact with and use that content. The help
provided will be speciﬁc to the dynamic content present in
the current page so as not to overload the user with too

much information. We assert that when users understand
how the dynamic content within Web pages operates, they
will be less hesitant about interacting with it. In addition,
due to the large variance in abilities of users, the tool will
only be available when required by the user. In the study,
some participants were comfortable using Web 2.0 content
where as other users were not. Providing assistance when
users do not require it will be frustrating and negate any
beneﬁts that any tool may bring.
