ABSTRACT 
Automatically  generating  location  overviews  in  the  form  of  both 
visual and textual descriptions is highly desired for online services 
such  as  travel  planning,  to  provide  attractive  and  comprehensive 
outlines  of  travel  destinations.  Actually,  user-generated  content 
(e.g.,  travelogues)  on  the  Web  provides  abundant  information  to 
various  aspects  (e.g.,  landmarks,  styles,  activities)  of  most  loca-
tions  in  the  world.  To  leverage  the  experience  shared  by  Web 
users,  in  this  paper  we  propose  a  location  overview  generation 
approach,  which  first  mines  location-representative  tags  from 
travelogues  and  then  uses  such  tags  to  retrieve  web  images.  The 
learnt tags and  retrieved images  are finally presented via a novel 
user interface which provides an informative overview for a given 
location.  Experimental  results  based  on  23,756  travelogues  and 
evaluation  over  20  locations  show  promising  results  on  both 
travelogue mining and location overview generation.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
The booming Web 2.0 technologies enable people to plan trips by 
surveying  experiences  shared  by  previous  travelers,  from  user-
generated  content  (UGC)  such  as  Flickr  images  [1]  and  textual 
travelogues. Location overviews with both representative descrip-
tions  and  images  are  highly  desired  to  outline  travel  destinations 
in such a scenario. We believe a good location overview should be 
both  representative  and  comprehensive.  Being  representative 
helps  identify  popular  landmarks  while  being  comprehensive  is 
even  more  important  because  travel  is  more  than  landmark 
browsing;  it  is  more  attractive  to  show  other  interesting  aspects 
such as styles (e.g., desert, ocean) and activities (e.g., dive, surf), 
which help travelers experience a virtual tour before their trips.

Figure 1. The framework of the proposed approach: (1) trave-
logue  mining;  (2)  location-representative  tag  generation;  and 
(3) image retrieval and overview generation. 
Although  location  overview  generation  is  important,  not  many 
research  efforts  have  been  dedicated  specially  to  this  problem. 
Some related work focuses on the issue of landmark/scene image 
selection. For example, [2][3] used content-based technologies to 
select  representative  images  (or  canonical  views)  for  a  given 
landmark  or  scene.  However,  such  methods  usually  suffer  from 
the  semantic  gap  between  visual  features  and  semantics.  Textual 
information (e.g., location names) is mainly used to trigger image 
retrieval to obtain images related to a location [4]. As a group of 
comprehensive  tags  and  related  images  are  very  informative  to 
show  the  characteristics  of  a  location,  in  this  paper,  we  utilize 
textual  information  in  a  different  way.  Instead  of  simply  using 
location  names  to  retrieve  images,  we  first  generate  location-
representative tags from relevant textual information, and then use 
these tags to retrieve web images. Both tags and images are pre-
sented  to  users  through  a  novel  user  interface,  to  finally  provide 
attractive and comprehensive location overviews. 
A straightforward approach to generating tags that characterize a 
location is to analyze the tags associated with Flickr images. Re-
cently,  mining  location-related  information  from  Flickr  tags  has 
been actively investigated [5][6]. However, as tagging on Flickr is 
open,  the  tags  are  semantically  unconstrained  and  only  a  part  of 
them are related to travel. Hence, it is a non-trivial task to distin-
guish such travel-related tags from others simply based on Flickr 
data, as there are few contextual evidences that can help. Besides 
Flickr data, we notice that people are creating and sharing a lot of 
high-quality travelogues on the Web on virtually any location. In 
contrast to Flickr data, travelogues not only naturally concentrate 
on  travel-related  themes  but  also  contain  much  richer  contextual 
semantics. In this way, travelogues provide a better data source to 
generate overviews and virtual tours for locations. 
Like  other  UGC  data  mining,  the  main  challenge  in  travelogue 
mining is how to extract the required information from the noisy 

801and  unstructured  data.  Specifically,  in  a  typical  travelogue,  the 
location  descriptions  are  intertwined  with  personal  opinions  or 
other common  topics such as accommodation and transportation. 
We refer to the semantics that characterize locations as local top-
ics and the others as global topics. That is, a local topic summa-
rizes  the  typical  characteristics  of  a  few  specific  locations,  e.g., 
beach  for  most  locations  by  the  sea;  whereas  a  global  topic  is 
commonly shared by many locations, e.g., taxi, airport. Intuitively, 
local topics are the most desired for location overview generation. 
Motivated  by  these  observations,  we  propose  a  framework  of 
generating location overviews by mining travelogues, which con-
sists of three modules, as shown in Figure 1. First, a probabilistic 
generative model is trained on a collection of travelogues crawled 
from the Web to learn global topics and local topics. Then, given 
a  location,  its  relevant  travelogues  are  projected  into  the  space 
spanned  by  the  learnt  topics  to  generate  location-representative 
tags  based  on  the  words  projected  onto  the  local  topics.  Finally, 
the generated tags are combined with the location name to trigger 
an  image  search  engine  to  retrieve  relevant  images;  the  tags  and 
images are eventually organized together to create an informative 
overview  for  the  given  location.  Although  we  mainly  focus  on 
generating  location-representative  tags  and  only  adopt  a  simple 
text-based  image  retrieval  method  currently,  better  image  selec-
tion methods can be easily incorporated into the framework. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces 
the algorithms and implementations. Evaluation results are shown 
in Section 3. Section 4 gives conclusions and future work. 

2.  MODULE DETAILS 
In this section, we describe the detailed algorithms and implemen-
tations of the three modules in Subsection 2.1~2.3, respectively. 
2.1  Travelogue Mining 
Probabilistic generative models such as probabilistic latent seman-
tic  analysis  (PLSA)  [7]  and  its  extensions  [8][9]  have  achieved 
success  in  many  text  mining  tasks,  by  assuming  that  each  docu-
ment is generated from a mixture of topics, where each topic is a 
probability distribution over words in the vocabulary
. We pro-
pose a probabilistic generative model which extends the standard 
PLSA  to  model  the  generative  process  of  travelogues  with  two 
distinct types of topics: global topics and local topics.

2.1.3  Parameter Estimation 
The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is commonly used 
for  maximum  likelihood  estimation  (MLE)  of  parameters  in 
PLSA-based  models.  However,  due  to  the  introduction  of  the 
regularizer, the parameter estimation of the proposed model goes 
beyond  MLE.  Hence,  we  apply  the  generalized  Expectation-
Maximization  (GEM)  algorithm  [10]  to  estimate  the  parameters 
(denoted  by
 for  simplicity).  Similar  to  [9],  the  algorithm  itera-
tively  finds  a  better  value  of

In  these  overviews,  it  should  be  noticed  that  1)  the  larger  the  node  size  and  the  font  size,  the  more  representative  the  tag  is;  
2) the closer the two nodes, the more similar their semantics are; and 3) the larger the picture size, the more typical the image is.

query,  a  ranking  list  of  images  is  retrieved  via  an  image  search 
engine.  In our  implementation,  the  ranking lists of  both tags  and 
retrieved images are truncated to retain several top tags and sever-
al  top  images  for  each  tag.  For  any  image  that  simultaneously 
occurs  in  multiple  lists,  we  only  retain  the  occurrence  with  the 
highest rank and remove the others from the corresponding lists. 
With  the  tags  and  images,  the  next  challenge  is  how  to  organize 
such textual and visual information and present a comprehensive 
and  easy-to-understand  overview  to  users.  Actually,  besides  the 
tags  and  images  themselves,  we  still  have  more  information  that 
may be interesting to users, listed as follows. 
• 

The representativeness of each tag: Users would like to know 
which tags are more special for the give location. 
The  representativeness  of  each  image:  Given  a  tag,  users 
expect to know which image is the most representative one. 
The  relationships  among  different  tags:  Some  tags  may  de-
scribe similar aspects of a location. Exploring such relation-
ships can help users better understand the location. 

• 

• 

The  representativeness  of  a  tag  is  ready-to-use.  For  image  rank-
ing, in current implementation we simply follow the suggestion of 
the image search engine. For the similarity measure of any pair of 
tags, we adopt the normalized Google distance (NGD) [11]. 
The user interface of location overviews is shown in Figure 3, in 
which we show all the information with a graph structure. In the 
graph, each node denotes a tag. The larger the node size and the 
font size, the more representative the tag is. For example, in Fig-
ure 3(a), Alcatraz, Pier 39, and Golden Gate Bridge are the most 
representative  tags  for  San  Francisco.  Each  tag  is  surrounded by 
its relevant images. Similarly, the larger the picture size, the more 
typical the image is. All the tags are organized in such a way that 
the closer the two nodes, the more similar their semantics are. For 
example, in Figure 3(b), the tags gamble and casino are adjacent 
to each other due to their high semantic similarity.

activities (e.g., surf, gamble) that are highly correlated with travel; 
while top Flickr tags are less representative and comprehensive. 
From  the  example  location  overviews  illustrated  in  Figure  3,  we 
can observe that, for locations famous for its landmarks (e.g., San 
Francisco), the tags tend to be dominated by the landmark names, 
with a few tags presenting other aspects (e.g., cable, muni). On the 
other  hand,  for  locations  with  diverse  aspects  other  than  land-
marks,  our  approach  captures  their  characteristics  that  are  attrac-
tive to travelers and described extensively in the relevant travelo-
gues.  For  example,  casino,  gamble  and  show  are  generated  to 
characterize Las Vegas from the perspectives of style and activity. 

4.  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In  this  paper,  we  presented  a  framework  of  generating  location 
overviews  in  the  form  of  tags  and  images  by  mining  user-
generated travelogues. Given a location, its representative tags are 
first  mined  from  relevant  travelogues  and  then  used  to  retrieve 
web images; the tags and images are finally presented via a novel 
user  interface.  Evaluation  shows  that  the  proposed  approach  can 
generate representative and comprehensive location overviews. 
For the future work, we plan to investigate  more effective image 
selection  strategies  to  take  full  advantage  of  the  information 
mined  from  travelogues.  Also,  it  is  necessary  to  tackle  various 
levels of granularity of locations to better meet application needs.

3.  EVALUATION 
We crawled 23,756 travelogues from IgoUgo [12] to form a cor-
pus,  covering  760  unique  locations  in  the  United  States.  After 
removing stop-words and stemming, we trained a generative topic 
model on the corpus to learn 50 global topics and 100 local topics. 
Table 1 shows some top words (i.e., words with highest probabili-
ties  in  a  topic)  of  the  learnt  topics.  It  indicates  that  global  topics 
capture semantics (e.g., accommodation, transportation, opinions) 
common  to  most  locations,  while  local  topics  capture  semantics 
(e.g., beach, canyon, ski) specific to only a few locations. 
We selected 20 locations, each associated with at least 100 trave-
logues, to evaluate the generated location-representative tags. Due 
to the lack of ground-truth, we manually generated one as follows. 
For each location, we first formed a pool of tags by  merging the 
top 50 tags mined from travelogues by our approach, called trave-
logue  tags,  and  the  top  50  tags  obtained  from  Flickr  ("tagsFor-
Place" API), called Flickr tags. Then, 10 graduates were asked to 
select  20  most  representative  tags  for  the  location.  The  20  tags 
with the most votes were finally taken as the ground-truth tags. 
We used the Flickr tags as the baseline and adopted precision@K 
(i.e.,  the  number  of  tags  that  match  the  ground-truth  ones  within 
top K tags divided by K) to evaluate the performance. As the re-
sults shown in Figure 4, the travelogue tags match more ground-
truth  tags  than  the  Flickr  tags.  With  K  increasing,  the  preci-
sion@K of travelogue tags is still more than twice as large as that 
of  Flickr  tags.  One  reason  is  that  the  top  Flickr  tags  tend  to  be 
dominated by words not informative enough to characterize loca-
tions,  although  some  common  or  noisy  tags  (e.g.,  travel,  city) 
have already been removed; whereas our approach utilizes global 
topics to capture and filter out such words. Table 2 gives the top 
travelogue tags and Flickr tags for five cities, with the tags match-
ing  the  ground-truth  shown  in  bold  and  italic.  It  shows  that  the 
tags  mined  by  our  approach  characterize  the  corresponding loca-
tions clearly and comprehensively, from diverse aspects including 
landmarks (e.g., statue of liberty), styles (e.g., island, beach) and
