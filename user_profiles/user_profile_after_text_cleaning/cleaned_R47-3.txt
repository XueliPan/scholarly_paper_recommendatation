generate user interface associate element type custom control type construct cod display layout engine custom user interface element type example three input field telephone element show figure one generate simple custom control custom control maintain data model whenever user update data maintain custom control element content work document associate custom control must update accordingly custom control layout engine support fix set function layout engine support follow major function update element content figure one user interface support edit command provide command menu trigger right button pointer select element insertion operation user control system provide appropriate insertion user select thus component able always keep work document ie subset valid document six seven upon completion insertion component may generate require require element slot work document yet valid element require present valid document contain work document require element slot generate two consecutive v pair v valid locally ie v follow immediately valid document contain work document require element slot appear prominent hint user insert order render work document valid component generate require require element slot user fill require element slot process iterate component generate require element slot result valid work document six seven make sense generate require require element slot upon since user tend complete valid document make iteratively without make hand user delete exist element component generate require element place deletion otherwise element delete could generate immediately may generate require element slot user fill element delete support neighborhood enhancement conventional insertion operation conventional insertion insert element position insertion neighborhood element may insert neighborhood around position insertion component determine legal position element insert user analyze syntactic consequence user able make delete data custom

layout engine invoke function return cod represent custom user interface display user user interact custom user interface event handle user input event handler detect user complete edit command invoke

maintain undo stack refer data require custom control undo edit command layout engine simply store onto undo stack whenever user execute undo operation layout engine invoke function undo custom control pass store previously custom control able execute undo little effort mechanism custom control indeed powerful custom control generate user interface embed control thus take advantage large
