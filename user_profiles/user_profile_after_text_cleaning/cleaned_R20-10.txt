assistant say system provide answer need consider short time system use three build scratch good result show support rout approach indeed useful also note may prefer use exclusively simply prefer consider information peace quiet without involve evaluate performance support rout approach would interest evaluate traditional precision recall measure four would allow us better estimate large share user question handle system unfortunately argue eight measure directly applicable kind system contrast traditional information retrieval interest retrieve document relevant question rather assume one item answer question enough still precision recall modify do finder system eight adopt recall redefine percentage question system return correct answer one exist instead precision new measure call rejection use define percentage question system correctly report unanswered among exist finder system evaluate across several different use measure since use traditional statistical information retrieval approach finder system use result likely valid also system will sacrifice rejection high recall use low match threshold value expect reach around recall combine result data rate duplicate question seventeen question analysis find system expect handle roughly ten question may seem low number consider large domain support system believe good result limit could expect rate higher would also possible achieve even better recall use advance information retrieval eight consider creation initially instruct create base question general enough instruction turn vague interpret different ways express confusion questionnaire show result also notice think difficult construct find right category new clear train could improve situation six experience field study provide number design implement support rout web assistant must clearly define kind question make vague make web unsure lead good definition question could possibly ask another user make item many think difficult formulate
