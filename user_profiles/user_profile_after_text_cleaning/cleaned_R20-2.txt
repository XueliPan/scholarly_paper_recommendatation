many benefit often teach already early school prevent many malnutrition obesity however many path towards healthy eat include follow lack time example young work parent struggle find enough time spend may will spend extra time come vary nutritious meal plan fast food always around corner lack knowledge many people know nutrition theory know constitute nutritious meal know importance variation consume much sugar wrong type fat lack money people struggle financially may find difficult justify seemingly unnecessary expense fresh use timely manner avoid waste lack skill many people know cook example care previous partner suddenly leave charge cook divorce may lead shift fast food consumption lack interest people eat simply important something do regularly survive depression lack appetite
