international workshop expert application comparison manually automatically assign base german bibliographic collection savoy computer science department university paper compare illustrate use manually automatically assign german document extract gird corpus second objective analyze usefulness specialize general thesauri automatically enhance query illustrate result use different search model vector space model language model two probabilistic model also propose different measure compute textual entailment two term allow us hopefully select appropriate thesauri expand document query automatically introduction last electronic bibliographic tool gain importance partly due fact electronic copy print media make available large scale scientific grow print cost especially color require tend favor electronic furthermore distribution electronic copy nowadays much easier faster print media information make available user must also able search record easily find pertinent information way scientific paper often title abstract freely available bibliographic record mainly due copyright issue hence scientific document often contain manually assign add increase match author information usually extract control vocabulary either add index person good knowledge give domain author example bibliographic record provide access scientific literature educational world paper want see whether manually add enhance retrieval moreover want verify whether automatically add might yield improvement since thesauri always available also use general thesaurus query document expansion may thus see information center specific general thesauri german language second part interest impact enhance query rather document especially interest searcher strong knowledge domain interest use domain specific term query formulation expand query use domain specific thesaurus might fill gap general specific language appropriate general thesaurus one rest paper organize follow section present relate work

result first want analyze impact manually automatically assign see difference efficiency human select versus automatically select second step automatically expand query use thesaurus intention improve retrieval effectiveness use four model describe section measure retrieval performance use map mean average precision value compute basis retrieve document per query use manually index evaluation first evaluate simple run search title abstract part document use short title query map depict second column table analyze effect manually add ie perform retrieval complete document search relevant information title abstract part also third column table label manual depict map search title abstract last column show performance difference consider manually assign table show inclusion manually add control vocabulary considerably improve retrieval result first indication show map without manually assign document expansion use model okapi map title abstract manual change table short query model okapi map title abstract automatic change document expansion use table model okapi map title abstract automatic change table table map model okapi gird change change map map query expansion short query us add bibliographic might helpful closer look result observe model example improvement query also decrease query question come worth spend human add manually add require time people qualify give domain therefore want analyze automatically add base thesaurus might yield performance improvement b automatic document expansion section present result obtain extend document automatically manual expansion expert select appropriate thesaurus base knowledge domain context document computer need algorithm select control term add expansion procedure mainly base textual entailment measure propose section v divide four step first select part document query extend term ti search thesaurus retrieve thesaurus entry term ti retain term wi j contain entry compute similarity score relate term ti use one similarity measure describe section v finish step term ti set couple wi j term wi j expansion finally since number potential might elevate select term highest score extend document document might less term available case candidate term add since number document expand quite high empirical analysis select similarity expansion procedure fix fifty also equal mean number control vocabulary term per document table show result retrieval use document expand table use expansion observe automatically enhance document improve retrieval compare manually add improvement query however query automatic document expansion perform better manual expansion example query map manual expansion suggest automatic expansion query map manual automatic expansion compare result slightly better still important decrease compare retrieval result without c query expansion part present result obtain extend query several test decide fix five ie query add five term extract form thesaurus use three measure present section v measure textual entailment term choose expansion term well four retrieval model two thesauri two query short one use title part longer use title description search complete document title abstract since test run show textual entailment measure perform present result measure table show recapitulation query expansion use similarity short query thesauri comparison observe query expansion bring improvement model okapi map gird change change map twelve eight eight thirteen thirteen table v map query expansion long query small map due minor change order retrieve document rather expect better retrieval relevant document expand query make longer query see table v closer look result model short query see improvement query decrease use thesaurus improve retrieval query decrease query radio example map use query expansion use boost map add word even perform map funk query however use drop map add improve map web world last example also show choice term expand query important expansion term might hurt performance might improve conclusion paper present use manually add search relevant information bibliographic record write german language manually assign extract control vocabulary considerably improve retrieval performance mean automatically add term either control vocabulary general thesaurus hurt retrieval performance second part try enhance query rather document inclusion query however improve retrieval result conclude add term extract control vocabulary may improve retrieval performance problem however choose right term add document try different select expansion term show performance human seem accurate select appropriate enhance retrieval performance contrary machine human person good knowledge give domain take account semantics pragmatics
