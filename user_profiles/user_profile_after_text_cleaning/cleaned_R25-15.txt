extra confusion whether key already select assumption affirm comment report subjective satisfaction prefer visual feedback like visual feedback best twenty prefer speech ask give reason preference appreciate simplicity visual feedback also felt visual feedback fluent pleasant mode type prefer visual feedback appreciate extra confidence give highlight instantly see letter go select quickly adjust gaze necessary also find short time focus selection long enough react adjust point gaze like speech feedback best want hear write say help follow type also help correct many otherwise prefer visual feedback comment speak feedback help correct many comment little longer dwell time might like speech combine visual feedback half find highlight focus visual mode distract disturb felt cause extra visual noise make hard concentrate type focus flash around screen also make concern something might select accidentally one third think extra highlight visual give advantage visual feedback focus selection long enough adjust focus gaze twelve eighty find type speed right felt speed slow three speed fast apply prefer choice feedback perceive type speed feedback five comment type felt fast visual mode much faster visual mode mention dwell time selection highlight probably cause extra stress one participant note similarly many comment speech felt fast reason cause lot eight prefer mode actually mode addition question also give location key red color use visual feedback note several location key optimal current setup key locate top right corner virtual keyboard similar location backspace key standard however comment key locate near possible type text field since often need check text delete character experiment also point need somehow help correct text typically check type text field every correction make subject study indicate red color selection annoy comment red color strong compare light gray background one participant also comment red mean denial warn thus neutral color would better possibility change color important user preference may actually affect performance case five discussion study show type speed speech feedback significantly either two visual feedback analysis error rat type show main problem speech feedback cause unintended double visual feedback find confuse even measure performance reasonably good short dwell time simple visual feedback yield best result though compare experiment al current study type speed faster obviously since shorter dwell time use overall error rat higher decrease accuracy surprise since always trade speed accuracy text entry task however speak feedback accuracy decrease considerably visual duration speak feedback problem short dwell time use eye type however speak feedback study mean could work different condition length speak feedback longer dwell time al contrary speech visual feedback combine visual speech produce visual feedback alone therefore assume adjust speech synthesis better result could achieve reason current experiment simply realize many cause data experiment analyze one possibility adjust speech would make speech synthesizer speak faster sharper soft fade addition length speak feedback problem speech achieve sharpness clearness short red flash use visual feedback thus may clear selection make soon speech synthesizer activate letter speak work well conventional mouse may require extra careful design eye mouse problem exact point selection also arise program point view feedback standard click event use feedback practice click consist two key key click event happen focus move away key hold cause annoy user click key gaze selection cancel gaze move away fast short time show key visually go error type avoid use key event trigger anyhow emphasize need define distinct point selection happen make sure user behavior accordance type rhythm another issue worth consider type series action include search selection key take time search next key also dwell time elapse key type rhythm break search time include note couple would want even longer dwell time key repeat use experiment normal plus add furthermore short click sound would better support type rhythm visual feedback alone auditory feedback find support temporal task rhythm better visual feedback alone brewster al feedback also affect type rhythm speech mode duration speak feedback vary depend speak letter take considerably less time speak discuss point selection clear distinct selection happen immediately define dwell time elapse allow user instantly proceed word user force wait feedback finish whether duration dwell time adaptive constant every character yet another interest question add dwell time user continue focus select key prevent false double space key might another special case consider experiment see especially tend either forget space altogether briefly glance space proceed next word one explanation could people think word type something extra perhaps dwell time space key shorter however adaptive automatically adjust dwell time use adaptation interfere type rhythm study adaptive scan alternative communication system discover automatic adaptation increase develop scan rhythm automatic adaptation interfere would like hear simple click sound comment short red flash seem enough click leave study simplify experimental setup however assume click sound would help type performance discuss paper research show add auditory feedback effective way improve visual feedback find reason believe thus still recommend add click confirm selection together visual feedback improve many felt visual feedback important speak feedback alone sufficient couple comment sometimes hard discriminate letter speak feedback alone example n sound quite similar also locate next keyboard layout add visual feedback would confirm selection increase bite surprise visual feedback error rat demonstrate experiment many long enough time react gaze actually correct point gaze short time interval focus selection thus dwell time short possible comment participate experiment longer dwell time faster better six result show short dwell time essential feedback sharp clear thus brief feedback use short dwell time feedback consume dwell time need select next character furthermore distinct point selection make visual auditory feedback take time uncertainty exact moment selection do
