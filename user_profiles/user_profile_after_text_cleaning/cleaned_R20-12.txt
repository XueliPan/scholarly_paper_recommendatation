future information extraction manual extraction user model data cumbersome indicate assistant questionnaire result system relieve human task would improve live help term e convenience company could save time money could avoid unnecessary stress examine consultation dialogue either chat log assistant usually follow one discover phrase reveal information user two associate phrase attribute user model hierarchy three update attribute value individual user model process natural language process problem consider language chat though grammatical semantic understand perform dialogue sixteen ten currently feasible also consider long term information comparatively vague nature understand necessary either one solution information extraction ie ie understand natural language partially clear intention discover store c information nine consider follow sample dialogue line take log assistant digital draw tablet would suit nicely user one prefer mouse work better reason read human assistant could one discover user model phrase one prefer mouse work better two associate phrase attribute graphics digital three update user model information own graphics tablet prefer digital draw instrument mouse altogether involve solve three task ie domain entity name mouse name entity recognition replace anaphoric term one entity name digital draw tablet mouse respectively resolution make relevant around entity name associate phrase attribute update attribute value respect previous value template element construction dialogue analysis observe one conversational play important role resolve example replace one entity name refer show circumstance reference entity name appear pair phrase two dialogue language style ie parse example include misspell repeat word miss sentence separator mouse ie parse need tolerate enhance implement user model tool integrate easily portable ie module basic design either follow base interpretation approach eighteen regular grammar drive fastus partial parse approach thirteen evaluation two prototype reveal user model acquisition task best handle focus context well grammar fragment inference data collection user model typically occur little piece information add several user interaction sessions therefore user model usually contain limit information consequently inference would valuable inference process reason uncertainty aim extend collect user data live help inference do either human automatic way inference manually disadvantage may time consume demand quite e ort also risk inconsistency thus automatic inference investigate alternative automatic inference user model data study previously extent traditional user model research however attempt design approach particular kind application consider special may distinguish previous research since user model use human great importance assistant need able trust user model data order feel comfortable use basis consultation inference system need able explain assistant whenever assistant doubt piece information ability inference system need able justify example assume assistant recommend user purchase expensive product base piece infer information user assistant would likely justify recommendation convince user ability somewhat di point fourteen even inference system could explain infer data explanation may justify action take base infer data handle di value type update user model may want go outside scope numerical attribute value provide new qualitative value importance special case occur value also may want explain attribute value give textual description value user inference system need able handle di type qualitative quantitative value one attempt apply inference user model stereotype approach nineteen twenty later general approach deal reason uncertainty apply user model fourteen consider three common approach namely network theory evidence fuzzy logic give present suitability possible approach inference need analyse care solution attempt course application hand must also take consideration see important direction future work privacy user model general perhaps particular raise privacy issue several study show consider privacy great importance see five inform eld study model collect data would use course give possibility opt believe user model really useful vital inform ongoing data collection process data use also allow control information keep one idea implement require web sit user digital signature user model allow use consider interest issue future work nine conclude consider two initial question raise introduction first
