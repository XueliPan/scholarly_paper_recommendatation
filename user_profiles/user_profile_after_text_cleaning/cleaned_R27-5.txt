impact collection size relevance diversity university abstract observe precision increase collection size one explanation could redundancy information increase make easier find multiple document convey information user interest read information would prefer set diverse search result cover multiple search topic paper look impact collection size relevance diversity retrieval result collection main find improve diversity randomly remove majority significantly reduce redundancy marginally affect coverage subject information storage retrieval evaluation efficiency effectiveness general term experimentation measurement performance diversity relevance collection size one introduction hawk two establish precision certain rank cutoff increase collection grow size equal collection contain relevant document make intuitively easier find fix number hence postulate one amount relevant information increase collection however add document collection lead diminish return since information already cover collection increasingly hard add new information hence postulate two amount redundant information increase size size web track diversity task one address issue redundancy return information diversity put impact collection size precision interest perspective one hand topically relevant prerequisite desire result accord first postulate would make collection size beneficial hand redundancy information harmful accord second postulate would make copyright hold ten geneva collection potentially detrimental try determine relative importance two oppose force hence main research

sample average five sample impact collection size number relevant document obviously random sample fraction relevant page increase proportionally collection first postulate hold impact number least one relevant result see different pattern start five sample already contain forty sample size thirty collection contain relevant page eighty fraction overall even higher analysis show small sample already cover vast majority relatively small fraction relevant document sample contrast contain many relevant document additional figure one impact collection size fraction relevant page relevance figure two impact collection size result diversity table one redundancy diversity relevant information sample topic ten twenty thirty forty fifty sixty seventy eighty ninety top ten twenty sixteen twenty twenty three redundancy diversity analyse effect reduce collection size redundancy relevant information diversity coverage top retrieval run table one show number relevant page per topic two three impact collection size redundancy relevant information number relevant page hence redundancy steadily increase sample size eventually collection contain many relevant document per topic second postulate also hold impact diversity coverage top rank table one show number informational navigational total cover relevant document top ten run four five six respectively restrict sample see initially number increase due increase coverage sample peak taper due increase redundancy sample analysis show collection size impact redundancy coverage imply diversity fix depth decrease collection size except sample coverage still increase noticeably four retrieval effectiveness finally analyse effect reduce collection size performance web track diversity task test collection figure two show impact collection size di performance top two line show measure ten twenty bottom two show measure ten twenty show variance five sample ten ten keep figure readable variance similar rank twenty variance twenty thirty collection see initial increase performance sample size fifteen collection however performance increase remain relatively stable across sample size thirty fact performance rank ten actually decrease line result table one support validity measure analysis lead remarkable conclusion result diversity importance improve performance randomly remove result collection retrieval run five analyse impact collection size relevance coverage redundancy diversity find number relevant document increase coverage quickly saturate result redundancy information steadily increase lead lower diversity result lead remarkable conclusion result diversity importance improve performance randomly remove majority significantly reduce redundancy marginally affect coverage result base standard
