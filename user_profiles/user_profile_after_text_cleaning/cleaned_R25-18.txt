query formulation web information search aula unit interaction department computer information university abstract query formulation essential part successful information retrieval challenge formulate effective query emphasize web information search web use diverse population vary level paper factor affect query formulation web information search study data collect via questionnaire formulate twenty query result study suggest experience use web web search affect query formulation process surprisingly domain effect query formulation generally experience formulate longer specific query whereas query less experience consist generic term base previous study concern query formulation result questionnaire study three main factor affect query formulation suggest one media two domain three type search factor take account study design information search search query formulation user one introduction ever grow world wide web web search necessary tool efficient information access user population search extremely heterogeneous consist example computer look material fun require accurate efficient search professional purpose currently search design serve population whole usability however produce enormous meet challenge diverse user population search engine must thoroughly know search possible different user group information search complex process consist four main step problem identification need articulation query formulation result evaluation process affect environmental search topic searcher search experience search process command use search outcome precision recall study focus searcher affect query formulation typically study focus information search specifically query formulation study search bibliographical study provide background study query formulation web search web search different population need study independently complete understand search plenty train query formulation whereas web usually train furthermore may special interest train place search demand position provide relevant result even though query often vague imprecise user underlie information need furthermore lack organization material web make impossible formulate efficient query consider content index term control international conference extent bibliographic thus even professional might need use different web information search compare search bibliographic although bibliographic information search information search web environment differ significantly study focus former also review currently study web search focus query formulation whereas literature traditional search abundant furthermore despite search text base information retrieval underlie problem user communicate information need computer relevant information retrieve study web usually focus large search engine log file pooch al al spink al study focus understandably quantitative data number search term use search task try formulate query successfulness search use query general log study show web use short query typically one three term seldom use advance regularly iterate query go couple result page per query several study find search behavior generally media search system web improve performance search task query formulation typically use longer query al longer query usually use advance familiarity topic search task also affect query formulate become familiar topic query formulate become longer detail nevertheless story quite simple another study less topic experience formulate longer query experience author assume domain know appropriate term thus need however assumption study detail addition user type search task also affect search task categorize two group question exploratory search close question al white open close nature task show affect differently general experience web able change flexibly al different type task affect different query formulation currently know search information provide system underlie information need better typically mean long query possibly use advance provide better result simpler query furthermore seem reasonable expect people get better information search practice al card conclude information search compare expect formulate better ie longer complex query generally review study support idea although result always consistent thus need study query detail see query formulate previous study query describe numerical level usually information give term choose specificity generality study al show almost search sessions data set log data search engine consist one query however reason could infer data possible find information look immediately possibly give soon notice search successful unpublished experiment also show similar behavior one experiment ten give eight search task give five find answer task analysis search behavior show four least one unsuccessful task submit one query five minute time instead try improve query choose go result set entire five minute time addition lack iteration commonly follow initial choice generality search term use start search general term usually narrow search even search task could complete although majority seem adopt search term write task generalize even term find description use broad term query example task find answer question much blood human heart pump one minute one user initial query human biology query indicate markedly different approach find answer query formulation web information search task query heart blood minute formulate another user result clearly emphasize importance study namely formulation initial query many case initial query may fact one user submit nicely illustrate challenge face text base information retrieval guess word use query adequately represent person problem use system representation task presumably easier goal study user affect guess make thus design empirical study study factor affect initial query formulation two empirical study questionnaire seventy give send mainly staff university questionnaire consist

presumably intend three factor affect query formulation base previous study concern query formulation result questionnaire study three main factor affect query formulation suggest one media familiarity search environment b search engine c computer information retrieval two domain three type search task suggest factor find affect initial query formulation present study nevertheless expect affect query formulation process reason present media web show affect search process successfulness search increase however effect query formulation clear result show web computer experience correlate number search term use type query broad precise user prefer experience web user searcher likely use straight information search style rather navigate information style style see opportunistic try find information immediately sometimes get result query sea reason environmental effect return zero hit hand seem prefer find least something continue search thus prefer query start query sea return hit assume experience user become web search become tool rather something spend time thus want search information efficiently possible see something interest happen come web experience also make understand structure material usual style write web requirement successful information search pollock international conference benefit experience use expect arise automatic move example keyboard mouse usage automatic whereas require cognitive automatic move leave primary task search information additionally computer experience expect implicit effect information retrieval computer illiterate people often uneasy use fear make mistake break computer use longer time people inevitably learn order use need try without clearly understand everything happen people understand search really work still use well information retrieval sense expect understand possible text base information search thus may better think search task conceptually make advance query base conceptual task analysis use broaden narrow query need understand different index relevance sort whether word index basic inflect form whether ways weigh search term higher relevance rank might successful formulate effective query domain presumably help people query formulation give possibility use either term query possibly accurate term thus domain directly expect lead longer query quality select term expect high divide search task three broad exploratory comprehensive search task source information key issue naturally searcher wish find correct answer question source information better however experimental search task personally important credibility source likely important factor task result set key issue efficient search thus good query offer user precise set result size result set important high precision achieve use precise term phrase query typically formulate query consist several term hand exploratory search task searcher aim obtain general idea search topic possibly retrieve couple document example task high precision result set necessarily important thing high level recall instead searcher may find relevant document simple query possibly use search engine result start point relevant document find follow thirdly task find many document possible give topic comprehensive search task recall high possible search successful search task recall need high level precision inevitably suffer high recall require user use term term truncation maximize recall particularly web level precision number result retrieve acceptable level query must still important search topic different level experience use web web search different type task equally challenge exploratory task broad style search style less experience seem prefer presumably good strategy narrow query important task may forget whereas broad start make easy user collect new query term retrieve document however submit broad query like toss coin may win find appropriate document immediately likely end pile useless document still answer question good know narrow search get rid irrelevant document web computer topic search engine supposedly helpful comprehensive search process search become important key success order find realistically important information topic searcher must make several successive query formulate one comprehensive query order formulate comprehensive query user must know use advance task general understand information retrieval logic beneficial one measure successfulness information search two measure recall precision typically use recall measure ratio relevant document find total number relevant document whereas precision tell number relevant document retrieve divide total number retrieve document query formulation web information search four discussion paper predict level experience use web search make difference query formulation addition also type search task knowledge information retrieval general familiarity topic search expect make query formulation either easier even challenge study information search user study factor need take account possible confound test design furthermore result suggest order help information search necessary assist already query formulation phase help provide example suggest specific query term basis initial query surprise result people use web less frequently use query frequent web compare result however query analyze detail notice time use unnecessarily search engine automatically add importantly logical query also relatively common seventeen case use result suggest people less experience may want formulate sophisticate query considerable formulate correctly take account design search offer support query formulation interpretation likely experience already learn need use necessary strive efficient search performance thus minimize unnecessary complexity study reveal effect predict affect query formulation supposedly due methodological issue search task choose differently familiarity domain task might effect query formulate task specific query term could find hand possible domain knowledge important initial query become important later query turn simple term enough study population fill questionnaire quite homogenous although different educational background experience computer fact mo st previous study people five computer web experience would immediately call however find different experience level
