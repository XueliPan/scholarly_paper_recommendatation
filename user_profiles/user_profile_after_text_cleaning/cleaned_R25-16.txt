physically demand depend time exercise heaviness train neck shoulder pain common problem severely impair quality life especially prevalent among sedentary also among young people general less prevalent among physically active people especially among people participate sport dynamically load upper fitness box one sport six heart rate monitor often use measure level exercise seven exercise increase heart rate keep appropriate level twenty exercise increase cardiovascular fitness optimal level heart rate exercise roughly approximate age person know study follow use approximate optimal exercise level age fifty lower limit age upper limit currently physically interactive game camera base game dance mat become available large public technology become accurate enough provide pleasant play experience giant bounce three two dance game five game control body aim decrease disadvantage continuous mouse keyboard use well sit passively front computer however game target none far know develop mainly physical exercise study computer vision technology could use track user control computer game character mimic user action shadow user evaluate game carry user study study user heart rate measure determine physical effect play game additionally playability usability game study observe play game interview afterwards shadow boxer prototype shadow boxer user suppose use basic fitness box include three punch straight hit hook punch sideways movement since rapid goal use wizard approach user test prototype use one computer vision control control sideways movement augment keyboard functionality use wizard control player punch general method widely use design collect language corpora review see one previously apply method successfully physically interactive action game four decide adopt similar approach project important benefit use method elicit user evaluate game application put extensive effort implement computer vision prototype design implement use computer vision hear platform three game functionality implement use flash author environment finally embed platform access information user horizontal position camera view short user horizontal position control computer whereas punch control wizard build tool game functionality game consist three main part warm video trainer write video correct figure one shadow boxer game window player manage remove one point glove mark disappear circle figure two three type point punch present figure one actual game window game player move sideways front web camera make punch control game character task punch point figure two move sinusoidal fashion screen must punch appropriate time punch effective vertically horizontally position game character goal make point disappear punch correct punch long need number point indicate many punch require make disappear three different require different punch straight hit hook punch type point change every time hit wall game window five four average age volunteer test regular average exercise per week university addition nine two research group play game order us get heart rate data test carry usability laboratory laboratory two room separate mirror person act wizard observer sit control room participant test interviewer test room experiment use run game attach flat monitor loud creative pro place besides monitor polar heart rate monitor eight use heart rate first tell task would play computer game control body heart rate monitor put initial heart rate measure take next ask familiarize game participant show appropriate distance monitor motion track work participant put box start play game figure three game heart rate take second time last task figure three participant play game figure five heart rat game one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven participant one two e n r e p e e r r e h eighty sixty forty twenty significantly result play shadow boxer ten p one game couple deliver punch one hand one realize also hand use tell use hand play game several one hand problem stem instruction punch show one hand keep simple possible people might play game without formal train fitness box important game teach wrong punch video show series punch instead one punch might improve situation make easier people understand deliver punch correctly decide quickly proper punch point change hit wall game window however consider serious problem instead challenge would overcome subsequent time play game problem start game decide proper time deliver punch take relatively long time understand wait point right position vertically punch first try punch upwards soon notice work even try jump order reach point high make first time game play easier would need tell detail game play hand nothing discover game might particularly interest play game character stop time start punch point however sometimes keep move punch punch participant ask find stretch mode game stretch want play game interview interview question relate nature controllability game character visual appearance game feel arouse game additional question deepen question ask need result heart rate play game heart rate approximate optimal exercise level three figure four participant three heart rate level whereas heart rat eight eleven higher optimal however note calculate sophisticate optimal exercise level could somewhat different generally heart rat game markedly higher heart rat game figure five pair sample confirm heart rate increase figure four heart rate play game optimal exercise level stop character make jump sideways adjust position position player make difficult learn size movement require adjust sideways position thus would better character stop punch start movement character resemble movement player closely possible interview game consider clear sufficient tell move game character fully correspond base general knowledge box describe visual appearance computer game simple clear improve game would diversify clarify feel arouse game different seven felt positive negative feel play shadow boxer negative feel mostly due understand point punch almost tell would like play shadow boxer discussion study confirm find four method apply test physical interaction however important note control use wizard simple enough simulation computer behavior realistic possible case wizard interpret participant launch one three punch press correspond key keyboard enough rest time also necessary wizard able act consistently fast enough test play game eight eleven heart rate optimal level aerobic train result suggest shadow boxer might use exercise although game last longer test average length game five order enhance cardiovascular fitness exercise last least twenty user study show usability interface game small bug need fix minor structure game one possible reason usability might stem use flash game people might familiar flash web environment application people experience flash visual appearance control button different flash compare example study use heart rate monitor external device mean actually connect computer game however future would beneficial integrate monitor game allow computer adapt react user physical condition level exercise example speed point could reduce heart rate increase much increase heart rate drop optimal exercise level addition help user profile game could guide player exercise level exercise stay desire level game could mean heart rate exceed desire value game character get totally tire start move stop move altogether game character would move normally heart rate return desire level first would like thank test would also like acknowledge advice give graduate school project also fund graduate school reference one n l wizard study proceed international workshop intelligent
