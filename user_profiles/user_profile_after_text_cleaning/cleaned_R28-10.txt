recommendation algorithm recommend query relate original query method aim improve two g eleven relate work well know query reformulation strategy relevance feedback one main idea present user list document relate initial query examine user select relevant use important term attach select document possible reformulate original query add term query representation document vector model recent work also incorporate log useful source data strategy two example five large query log use construct surrogate document consist query close match document find query match document fair description content also investigate whether query play role query expansion sense eight somewhat similar approach summarize document query propose query association base notion query highly similar document good

discard document select mistake time similarly say query set document consistent document set consistent query query recommendation method many identical query represent di user information need depend topic user mind tend select particular subgroup document consequently set session original query might attempt assess exist document select sessions query create cluster identify query relevant cluster prefer simpler direct method cluster do level query sessions four g let set document select session query q make assumption represent information need behind q might wonder query consistent better rank document query exist potential query repeat procedure session original query select potentially recommendable query appear number sessions propose user interest q need introduce criteria
