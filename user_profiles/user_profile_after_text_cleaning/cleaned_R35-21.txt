information retrieval model instead simple index semantic search system process semantic query return set instance see form query expansion set instance represent new set query term lead higher recall value implicit query expansion achieve inference rule exploit class rich concept provide useful information mean document summary proposal achieve follow respect search better recall query class instance example query government would return document mention zapatero former even word president government present document better precision use structure semantic query structure query allow express precise information need lead accurate answer instance system possible distinguish query basket team team possible semantic query better precision use query weight low weight use impose
