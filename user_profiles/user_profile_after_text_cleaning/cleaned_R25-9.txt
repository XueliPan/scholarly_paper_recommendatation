faster system b result warrant dependent situation overall result give important information usability system three measure productivity section provide overview exist tool measure productivity addition measure productivity improvement result use mobile business service discuss traditional productivity measurement despite productivity paradox early five widely agree significant impact output company thus productivity four productivity define simply output divide input use generate output input consist labor capital energy output consist service several traditional tool available productivity measurement total productivity partial productivity physical productivity total productivity total output divide sum input measurement total productivity difficult different type output input sum compare directly therefore partial productivity measure commonly use partial productivity ratio calculate divide total output input factor labour productivity good example kind measure ratio calculate divide total output number labour input partial productivity calculate total output determine simpler method use physical productivity measure obtain divide typical output number service essential input labour amount physical measure output input express volume nineteen however measure effect mobile business service productivity traditional measure may difficult business process change indirect influence improve customer satisfaction service one example three note information technology investment may create intangible assets positive impact productivity company traditional measure fail take account intangible factor quality timeliness flexibility user satisfaction security ten indirect subjective productivity measurement indirect productivity measurement use data need partial physical productivity measure available idea behind indirect productivity measure certain phenomena relate productivity include high defect rat machine defect unused capacity high material scrap unnecessary transport poor atmosphere long wait time indirect productivity measure focus factor closely relate productivity use explain reason behind change productivity nineteen lot case use traditional productivity measurement present require collection quantitative data sometimes input output easily quantifiable may difficult even impossible collect data need productivity measurement example service work input output intangible quality subjective productivity may vary measurement one possible method subjective productivity measure base personnel subjective data usually collect use survey interview see nineteen traditional objective productivity measure also subjective measure direct indirect direct productivity measure example partial productivity physical productivity objective survey question regard productivity subjective indirect productivity measure example unused capacity unnecessary transport long wait time objective wait time need subjective nineteen survey question concern four explore success factor mobile business service main aim paper study factor effect success mobile business service construct preliminary questionnaire measure level success give variability tool already available measure usability productivity review previous section human computer interaction mobile service seven much need develop yet another set tool us two main reason begin quest develop yet another tool first current tool address specific context interest namely mobile service business use second current tool address usability productivity strongly feel need address order measure success order understand success factor mobile service use mobile work context conduct two case study accept incoming request first case study examine mobile business service use taxi book dispatch taxi use service constantly daily work drive service use example search address map message dispatch taxis service use fix device touch screen second case study study mobile business service use construction sit weekly safety safety delegate observe various safety issue construction site use mobile service document service use mobile phone collect data mobile service business use focus group interview data collection take place spring first case study conduct two focus group total nine taxi two pair interview analyze success factor mobile work context use taxi order book dispatch system evaluate service perspective new observe train almost fifty driver three train sessions sessions use mobile service complete typical usage classroom set focus usability issue taxi system two usability spend one hour use demonstration system complete typical taxi driver task accept customer locate address map change interface evaluate flow interaction usability issue gain wide business perspective theme relate success mobile business service interview taxi company manage director chairman board second case study one group discussion construction site discuss use service construction company service provider addition interview one user another construction site observe three two different construction sit use mobile service perform safety measurement see figure one better understand challenge new service bring along also observe traditional safety measurement process safety measurement do fill paper form figure one two construction complete measurement researcher observe leave ask fill questionnaire data analysis first case study interview record digital voice recorder transcribe analysis transcribe interview analyse qualitatively order find important theme data collect make detail note find expert discuss group elicit common understand important theme five result section present theme relate success mobile business service find case study section present initial version questionnaire measure success mobile business service success factor reveal case study case study find mobile business service need similar usability service need effective efficient pleasant easy use make easier mobile accept new service daily work company point view improve labour productivity see important success factor case mobile business service help perform work productively moreover service mobile safety important aspect success taxi drive construction walk around construction sit use service case need observe environment minimize interaction service avoid addition general usability productivity safety find important success service business use severe happen even learn use service learn take much time learn phase may human computer interaction mobile service seven expensive company deploy service work task do efficiently possible well service provider service provider cost due example numerous call extend need support relevant mobile work context thus revise otherwise relevant question exist tool better measure success factor important mobile business service also add new dimension success namely safety mobile context productivity use safety measurement service install mobile phase find play critical role success service succeed installation could easily switch back use traditional method perform work task construction company mean benefit service achieve installation phase critical taxi case taxi install service taxi case one factor large effect service level support whether felt receive enough support feel hear act upon support also important role construction case mobile safety measurement service need additional help move example one observation user know answer incoming call without distract safety measure measurement start result two system user support need combine two together moreover mobile business service need take account issue relate mobile context example need cope change environmental context taxi case find lose time time change location cold weather slow device sunshine make difficult read screen construction case lose connection also distract measurement process small key mobile phone difficult use especially wintertime development begin development questionnaire take exist questionnaire test second case study questionnaire simple quick fill unfortunately usefulness current context find limit take account mobility service business context example claim think would like use system frequently confuse must use mobile service perform work task also notice ambiguous find various function system well integrate case study several success factor identify effectiveness efficiency user satisfaction ease use safety ease installation support factor relate mobile context productivity effectiveness efficiency user satisfaction also emphasize iso standard definition usability fifteen efficiency satisfaction emphasize ease use example part tam eight addition installation support technical help part quis seven issue address exist tool quis use questionnaire tam specifically focus issue exist usability measure mainly develop mobile phone usability questionnaire exception use usability test contrast usability measure mobile business service must take account different use use service pose among mobile business service use different mobile phone fix usability measure need take account appropriateness device task addition exist tool take account fact service typically part story service may fail support work task part service mobile service rarely act independent tool work environment information need transfer somewhere thus important mobile service device enable fast easy connection address issue dimension mobile context include question relate actual physical context ie mobile device environment well overall system context see nine context consumer service subjective satisfaction extremely important factor large effect acceptability adoption service addition consumer service often freedom choice like current service choose another one business context often choice use system unfortunately often even say company decide service start use despite rather feel subjective satisfaction important take account also business context likely effect measure overall work satisfaction productivity order evaluate productivity impact add direct indirect subjective productivity measure theme mobile work productivity addition especially question theme efficiency effectiveness closely relate productivity question exist select base theme relevance business use select question modify mobile service work task emphasize note theme question need adapt base context apply example service intend taxi use inside need ask service well dust walk addition theme relevant deployment phase continue use example ease installation crucial early stag usage whereas effect efficiency productivity may observe longer use
