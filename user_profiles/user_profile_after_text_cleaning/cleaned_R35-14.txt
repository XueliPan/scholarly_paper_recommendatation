infer important type query semantic approach de de yahoo research barcelona one barcelona abstract paper present technique rank important type give query rather try find category query know query categorization approach seek find important type relate query result necessarily query category fall rank type therefore approach complementary subject information storage retrieval retrieval model general term experimentation type rank entity rank faceted search one introduction current web search paradigm search return order list represent web page interest past new form search appear academic literature novel commercial search service example page contain ie page type author use search result allow user browse filter base idea adopt early search product find shop sit travel search also allow select category search fall web music video faceted search two recently propose framework approach use term loosely refer general search expose user browse without explicit faceted search still apply develop automatic process content document extract crucial difficult problem faceted search choose important query problem facet rank rather document rank important determine use adapt presentation result change display cluster provide filter short internship yahoo research barcelona copyright hold eight entity retrieval er different trend modify traditional search engine paradigm phrase associate semantic type city san date er result user query rank list rather rank list one three interestingly entity retrieval provide useful information faceted search specially case explicit available analyse relevant query gain information type interest query example query new york city retrieve corpus relate city also relate important date city history tell us location date type important query type person organization similar problem select problem rank type select important type query could use information number ways example use display important type map date interest use entity retrieval automatic prediction relevant type query call problem entity type rank differentiate standard entity rank best knowledge first work study problem two entity type rank study problem adopt entity rank set describe three use corpus snapshot name automatically extract unique name three entity e represent name entity phrase associate type different type entity ranker work follow query execute standard passage retrieval algorithm retrieve relevant collect appear distance base rank algorithm apply e e e e log e e p e prior probability entity sentence e e maximum likelihood estimate p e compute top retrieve sentence query q entire corpus respectively one improve slightly three average rank ing propose three table one example query associate type query location date organization league organization location date organization query type type one type two location person country vehicle type three event table two average p n p two p one p three count score entity ranker system return query rank list e q order decrease score type rank system take input need produce rank list entity type q q least important type relate query family type rank function experiment express score q zero type otherwise weight function type query give position rank entity list e try number weight function report four seem interest us two one q two also try use weight function top k e three experiment conclusion weight function evaluate fifty query type relevance query create one launch query entity retrieval system two make relevance assessment return three order list type highest percentage judge relevant table one show example query type category three top important type infer describe query type always coincide top important type instance league organization important type part trade alliance date alliance history finally relate evaluation metrics use value gain value p n value precision value try evaluate effective would system select set relevant type give query thus define percentage relevant result type position n belong top n relevant type table two show result evaluation value parenthesis result use top k seventy entity result e q value k lead maximum value subset twenty query type rank weight function main difference four propose approach importance weight function give two also try polynomial exponential discount function without top result type count give weight regardless position even naive approach still achieve considerable performance score function give slightly importance top result score value higher improvement marginal weight function higher degree give importance first result slightly improve approach whereas yield greater improvement thirteen p one suggest relevant type frequent upper position result set entity retrieval system latter function seem adapt better distribution hypothesis validate examine top k seventy modification result show range eighteen approach thirteen six approach already give importance top position four conclusion work propose task entity type rank present method predict important type relevant query informational search task make use entity extraction entity rank propose achieve
