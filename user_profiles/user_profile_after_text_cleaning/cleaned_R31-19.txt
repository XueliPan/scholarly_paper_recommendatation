cross match query cross match query query special specify spatial spatial one area specify spatial range two specify probabilistic fuzzy spatial join area clause use specify circular range sky object return query lie within range clause use match object different archive astronomical body subsection use term body refer real astronomical object term object refer observation body store archive archive measure unique position sky ie right ascension declination astronomical body observe measure position would sufficient exact match object different archive except always unavoidable error measure position vary slightly archive archive assume measure position random variable distribute normally around real position body standard deviation error circular know survey value depend accuracy survey measure instrument use knowledge give set object one archive one compute probability cross match ie refer astronomical body give query clause specify minimum probability threshold set object consider cross match example take follow cross match query select first p area p galaxy two query first table three different federate namely first area clause limit query circular range center longitude latitude five radius arc second figure two different set object select base clause specify user query figure show set get select user specify p bo specify p select user get clause specify set object one three archive within standard mean position consider direct correspondence specification specification term minimum probability threshold set object mention example figure two position body observe archive p similarly bo b b p body b assume satisfy area clause mean position two set respectively note mean position depend consider compute mean sake simplicity assume always position show figure also show body range standard mean position three object within range set cross match set body b bo cross match range clause also specify absence match example instead clause p would imply selection set object one first two archive within standard mean position match object last archive within error bind last archive call drop note drop specification correspond exclusive outer join figure two p cross match specification bo archive specify clause drop out call mandatory query execution optimization query execution see figure three incur process cost individual transmission cost send partial result one next reduce process cost use efficient algorithm cross match computation reduce transmission cost first send performance query estimate maximum size partial result transmit
