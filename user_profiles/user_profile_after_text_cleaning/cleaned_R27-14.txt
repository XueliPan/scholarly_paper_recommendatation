range different task approach two twenty six use top n retrieve page extract term phrase expansion approach differ exploit overlap search query title article select one entry page query expansion keep focus topic query although use multiple article might give vocabulary relate term choose often exploit improve recall choice use single article specifically topic query hop lead relate term closer original query term thus result increase precision addition reason article often edit multiple author together vocabulary author individually order extract useful term query expansion associate query page use well know formula aim select n term best discriminate give topic page rest article score term calculate log one frequency term document length document total number document collection number document contain term advantage use query page entry point query expansion best term every page thus make query expansion fast query time often do query expansion use term weight place emphasis original query term expand query employ simple term weight method whereby original query term weight n time n add term five term add original query term receive weight five add term get weight one note also experiment weight ing scheme compensate query different lead disappoint result weight scheme build score differentiate add term sum one original query term weight also divide number term
