ordinary search locate video require vast ocean video information current state art rely use provide use low level feature available exist representation associate retrieval task none sufficient

commonly know semantic gap two provide use low level feature bridge semantic gap one challenge research issue information retrieval today intention overcome associate video search develop video retrieval system use action involve previous search help inform subsequent system system require alter normal search behaviour provide supplementary feedback achieve available information user system

particular node wish see relevant document fact receive user interaction average interaction value irrelevant document average value relevant document average result show relevant document receive system certain point previous increase probability document relevant see figure two document higher relevance value probability tail slightly two main reason small number irrelevant document high relevance value firstly seem relevant first glance upon investigation relevant interact shoot investigate secondly number appear top common query thus increase chance interact figure two probability document relevant give certain level interaction represent probability video relevant represent assign interaction value graph since use collection task able calculate p n value vary value n also mean average precision map different group result show system use outperform system term p n return recommendation system much higher precision first system verify difference two p n value value n five statistically significant use pair wise p also find map select use recommendation system higher map select use system verify difference two set result statistically significant use pair wise p general trend map find use recommendation system increase amount train data use propagate graph base model result show see accurate result find accurate result tell full story number want find one result satisfy information need figure three show average time second take user find first relevant shoot recommender figure three average time second find first relevant shoot recommendation figure three see three four task use system find first relevant result quickly use system one task system outperform recommendation system due action two use however closer examination use find three find relevant less one minute none use system manage find relevant less minute variance result particular task system combination reflect error bar point figure three overall difference value statistically significant definite trend see result present section show achieve accurate result use system provide user exploration begin investigation user exploration briefly analyse user system table one outline many time action available use across entire experimental group see table one experiment enter query across four relatively little repetition exact query unique query total query fact four query occur ten time task task thus less scope use different search term indicate take number different approach view task indicate action determine carry task figure table one also show play quite
