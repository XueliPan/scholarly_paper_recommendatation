contain link page server line parse create file contain reverse link web page server file creation manipulation methodology main task server log processor parse give log file extract pair pair consist local page referrer page example server log file process identify page request server page request make instance example log file fig two pair extract extract pair group page base frequency request make group use create document page site file give name original web page consider individual choose store reverse link separate file several reason easy maintain update reverse regularly instead update original document time store transport share search separately document individual potentially use identify popular page purpose approach mean clean separation process add link document get referrer link form server log file although create individual could also create single entire however since process document dynamically ie user request page single document could mean long process delay would directly effect user experience load web page currently document store referrer page title experiment manually retrieve page title however easily use different example use web service retrieve parse referrer page get title course latter technique time consume since process do advance process speed important issue directly affect user experience title retrieval process also get information referrer example summary thumbnail image page retrieve tailor product user base personal detail provide web service web service link link link link link link title home page mark title title conference title title title figure three part document create link base store reverse link particular web page experiment generate reverse extensive quality check extract referrer example check whether point good quality page page however one imagine add number quality check server log processor see section six fig three show part reverse create index page document serve together original index page server process create list referrer link particular page simple structure mean easy quick process additional information retrieve referrer page document easily extend placement place reverse link store web page choose use name give combination web open source library family base allow web page retrieve small amount data server without reload entire page allow web page interactive behave like local also know rich client use within web page make call server request document document use augment document object model dom fourteen originate page main component object support across use several advantage base open support many document object model dom platform interface allow program script dynamically access update content structure style document provide platform solution popular sit use become familiar interaction model require install use also mean open web twenty part experiment page augment additional therefore page request site correspond reverse also request server return document parse list link store within local dom representation page list link transfer local dom display different ways navigation menu pop box fluid different part page decide reverse link provide similar secondary navigation present reverse link style also decide give user option display display reverse link therefore add link next user click link link list display fig four show home page site figure show place link list next link user click link label refer page help library link box display include list page refer particular page see fig five although hide reverse link display also add main content page experiment want change layout original content page little possible distract extra link especially page popular list get quite big actually observe number home page increase gradually since release potentially could problem page since hide link page reveal user eliminate problem five evaluation already state perform comprehensive user evaluation yet al seven present small user study compare page serve without show improve overall user experience even though application different ie browser extension ie serve part page study show incorporation navigation browser produce measure improvement quality information discover web informal initial qualitative result also support study suggest see positive addition browse experience indeed comment widespread adoption would change browse behaviour discovery web base would enhance interline technique display information link directly anchor use single line text show page location site hierarchy figure four home page conference figure five home page conference reverse link reliability informal evaluation provide interest feedback scientifically reliable intend carry support contribution case plan iteratively evaluate effect application small set subject time feed back qualitative result experimental prototype specifically plan use one application provide usage track functionality use proxy approach proxy help us better understand usage provide detail information user interaction page proxy able identify context reverse link use specifically able understand task additional reverse link support evaluation include final evaluation use control trial methodology attempt eliminate subjective bias part experimental subject six unanswered question experiment conclude server log use enhance web page reverse link experiment also raise number interest research question research need conduct better understand create reuse reverse link effect enhance user experience often parse log file experiment process main log file monthly seem work satisfactorily need conduct identify appropriate time period often would adversely affect speed responsiveness system infrequent reverse link may date update list reverse link server log file site notice number increase gradually mean list present user get bigger address frequency analysis request make extract however could also check time request make create list recently visit conclude one approach better need conduct technical compare usefulness reverse link create base different metrics address problem link exist within menu log every page server people click link example case would sufficient provide reverse link index page rather overload user link however aggregation may loose link example contain link index page domain ie reality separate personal ensure quality suggest link regard quality reverse link several issue need address example experiment observe follow case need special attention suggest actually case many could actually follow access suggest link actually page point ing site page point index page actually relocate therefore suggest exist example news article maintain regularly archive mean article change list give quality check need conduct address set develop encode log processor ensure extract referrer link good quality achieve reverse link experiment create reverse link web page question achieve actually link page fragment page fragment useful example target page quite long dense portal page case user follow reverse link index page target page long talk bottom page might confuse user page suggest reverse link alternative ways reverse link paper propose process log file create individual advance web service achieve different ways example web service create dynamically take log file return list reverse link however approach performance process delay issue would good conduct experiment compare con different seven access web server data log assert possible parse data log file extract refer individual page hold server interest typically address log protocol number therefore relatively straight forward distinguish client address address use pattern match discover web page link enough information hold within log identify link implement analysis achieve form bidirectional link address link associate user must traverse link web server log entry create however find
