obtain one c zero know best either c b depend respective value b c distinguish three case b one b c insurance expensive protection pick one si zero b stable nash equilibrium one ie everybody get attack really care attacker powerful enough knock security b c figure four utility function nash equilibria target game existence nash equilibria depend relative value b c b c protection expensive insurance pick zero si one c h zero mean incentive become slightly increase protection discard insurance everybody switch back attack h si zero since si zero immediately draw people revert si one utility c lead increase security level h shut insurance set si zero associate gain utility c much greater save revert back zero keep insurance continue everybody reach one c si zero c people incentive increase si zero utility everybody stage c b increase infinitesimally lead attack save c people eventually people keep up security level approach si one see figure four stage attack two equivalent either set si zero attack decrease zero si one utility indeed c case everybody adopt protection strategy however everybody become player utility go everybody incentive zero si one safe do everybody incentive defect set zero si zero short perpetual cycle nash equilibrium configuration b c one si zero stable nash equilibrium reason state sum attacker omnipotent people strong incentive pick high level protection insure situation markedly different previous case power attacker essentially drive people insure without protect protection expensive however stable nash equilibrium forty
