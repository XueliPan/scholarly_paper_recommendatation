find search narrowly main issue flaw result numerous information point basically cluster search result search use would improve ability end user locate relevant information limit expand search use primarily know item find know answer want exist happy find site answer use explore sure phrase search find key information reaccess experience use search information reaccess approach although seem frequently rely use search engine reaccess material strategy also problematic think main problem web search nowadays remember term use find relevant site find relevant information often iterative process especially experience five several query sometimes need find information almost impossible remember exact query use specific piece information find also difficult use search reaccess information originally find browse experience use frequently despite associate burden clear majority use since average collection link similar number present ten many plentifully yet large bookmark difficult organize require continuous maintenance one ten use sophisticate bookmark organization typical experience one however even experience unquestionably need organization struggle tool provide task several comment relate painful organization see sign serious usability exist bookmark tool ie make hard organize leave ugly pile rely much would like pain simple tree bookmark manager hide people also add even though sure whether information use disadvantage bookmark collection become clutter turn make organize use collection even difficult many bookmark page subsequently review save look like may relevant later know refer run similar search remember save information case may search hard drive use index server fact one computer make use difficult large number computer would like always accessible independently location machine meet would like go back one web store computer show something one solution would integrate search engine also suggest one tool ideally think web user get tool could centralize area available everywhere interest know benefit use large bookmark thus ten bookmark collection file ask experience appear active use use large proportion regularly although usually one folder active use time clean time time delete unnecessary file invalid link problem ten archive link nevertheless clean see activity do often probably clean twice year bet point least year since do cleanup find link seem obsolete try remember delete bookmark often much hurry lazy also carefully organize typically two three level ask successfulness bookmark organization happy people become indispensable tool spend lot time think organization order find need quickly possible several name base bookmark content example music work usability study news quite satisfy organization could somewhat less though yes highly successful need last ten literally really helpful thing would totally lose without folder thus seem valuable tool people will use extra time necessary keep collection organize outline significantly reduce utility tool struggle always chicken egg problem use different eleven exist tool might prevent discourage use beneficial infrequently use function discuss next misunderstand relate experience rarely rely history tool result show use history tool infrequently one problem history available one computer also use many different day certain browser history information help also possible reason infrequent use history tool suggest stack model use history tool might support user task addition history tool rely page title often poorly represent content page ten another problem history list inevitably clutter save page though visit actually irrelevant user along page important user reason compromise usability history result least experience seek alternative ways support information reaccess one way encounter include temporary use sometimes throw bookmark use little delete usually put temporary folder maybe start temp folder experience rarely save link web page couple possible self first provide possibility access another computer also one rationale behind add secondly people sometimes use incoming mail reminder use information although oneself add serve useful function study suggest use common several possible infrequent use possible need access home work thus need access may small use also decrease need people always use computer access example use hand although provide clear benefit computer independent access may still troublesome thus infrequently use mail require user two web browser application addition also require user save target computer user want use system additional bookmark storage add web page equally cumbersome home computer link link bar work file course convenient use file really transfer work folder home computer set something synchronize two query experience resemble typical web though imaginative use search increase experience previous result concern experience use advance mix claim use frequent fifteen show infrequent use five current result support latter view advance phrase search use frequently use rare reason experience formulate simple query might optimization use take little time effort still deliver satisfy result use work search service fairly sophisticate use pretty happy result virtually abandon use let control search query well experience resemble typical study log study care get result usually look first page result although query experience resemble may still successful experience may example choose suitable term use word likely appear relevant page currently analyze data determine whether term selection exist choose search term base specifically information want rather could imagine someone word site contain information quite fast accurate know right way present question reverse imaginary result page give right answer try figure another way thing might present web page web rarely check result beyond position result page search engine result list seventeen experience may check result page page check may result may even sporadically check list seem aware even best rank also use different result get sometimes jump page like fourteen check affect result rarely look second third result page set search engine result show experience function half default operator despite erroneous understand seem people still make successful query search engine search relational interest note know search work research work think work well basic type word search need much else however comment one user study five clearly show one problem cause misunderstand way selection query term almost random copy search term document example term yellow anything topic experience user think require term result carelessly enter term query include term nothing topic consequence result receive contain unrelated term skew likely miss several important document misunderstand six design typical web advance information search reaccess may difficult directly support current search web section first briefly present two research session highlight figure five tool design support various level information search reaccess task importance behind tool confirm result study number develop tool also raise discuss present tool research session highlight session highlight web companion interest collect add drag address icon address field browser drop anywhere add chronological list represent web page thumbnail mouse cursor place thumbnail enlarge tool tip display title page appear result collection save later reopen access collect supplement collection although basic functionality session highlight resemble approach visual presentation automatic chronological order continuous presence change nature tool easily store intermediate search result tool ideally support various stag search process relate exist two however design approach differ greatly tool detail description session highlight reader refer twenty categorize search interface search interface enhance search automatically generate example query jaguar present jaguar jaguar onca mac jaguar jaguar mean present different word jaguar use result act filter upon category selection show result contain term present category name similar approach suggest thirteen solution simpler categorization base word phrase thus logic behind categorization easy understand contrast hierarchical categorization commercial categorize search sixteen produce simple flat categorization detail description result two user study refer figure five session highlight leave right outcome search search result list four relevant link another search result list three relevant link collect session highlight easy access advance multiple result show multiple web browser often use parallel search session provide track search history well easy access previously visit page although provide benefit multiple browser disadvantage clutter addition multiple may less intuitive use less experience web usually allow multiple instance application open time thus think rather support browse open multiple use session highlight use multiple longer necessary collect page interest rather open new user constant visual summary key page recognize typically much easier recall three twelve use less cognitively demand remember web page open background additionally know people remember visual information well three use visual cue recognize web page thus conceivable user need access open page use page title mislead miss altogether window menu name performance recognition task also present use search engine reaccess material use search get back previously find information widely use strategy however strategy difficult remember exact search term use find material first place alleviate problem plan include category would show user document among result list visit recently practice maintain history list every time user submit query compare history list result set recently visit document find show category recently visit document user addition normal inside category result organize temporally recent visit top list approach facilitate revisitation relevant previously visit result somewhere result list among first result situation may happen search engine update rank order result change addition user remember exact query term use document find first time rank relevant document may considerably different session highlight also provide ways overcome relate use search information reaccess conduct search may add search result page well result thereby preserve successful query key find collection save session highlight enable search session continuation later time thus user need recall specific query term even search engine use whole result page query term result save addition browser history leave intact subsequent sessions link color indicate result list already visit altogether need recall query repeat lengthy search process abolish store document save document file print document paper also commonly use among experience remove risk relate instability web content use current tool always risk page unavailable need next time information lose remove risk lose important information could automatically save copy page hard disc user indicate page important although copy document require space cost disk space low compare price lose important information addition secure information also make possible access information independent location however print document costly thus access document manner without print would beneficial achieve search could provide possibility save well copy document practice could provide service store web page search engine would also search personal collection thereby alleviate relate organization revisitation functionality allow access different without cumbersome add oneself session highlight also address report bookmark collection clutter management promote behavior whereby work set first collect leave evaluation second phase evaluate key importance add bookmark collection document thus user focus search task without distract concern bookmark management help understand query surprisingly experience know search engine handle query multiple term presumable even less understand issue alleviate relate misunderstand implement query explanation feature integrate table one present couple query tool translate query natural language phrase use query parser explanation practice default elaborate query operator precedence mistake use table one query query explanation jaguar jaguar game jaguar game match document contain word jaguar match document contain word jaguar game match document contain word addition document contain either word jaguar word game translate natural language thus correctness query easy check although advance term commonly use web query natural language help understand default function search engine handle query without addition one reason use may know use correctly thus benefit usage natural language also expect help problem evaluate filter result set experience report use categorize search need get overview result set topic search general addition use additional search term provide benefit evaluate success query easier add category name search term query addition provide easy access relevant result list important functionality typical web normally check first ten twenty result seventeen experience sometimes check also result rank thirty set search engine show result one page addition query less experience typically short broad rank search engine necessarily position relevant result top list even user may know result relevant help problem user easily access also result high rank seven past research mostly identify information search reaccess experience either mean observational study interview log data build previous find compile comprehensive list information search reaccess identify relative importance among vary group experience questionnaire approach make possible gain broad understand regardless tool people use addition provide valuable information behind different well reveal new better understand arm greater support design tool information search reaccess additionally question clearly show even experience find reuse information web fact receive much attention previously certain experience actually effective efficient least seem successful less experience fifteen thus believe advance would also benefit less experience furthermore force people use find beneficial support advance simply add possibility less experience response three research question follow common browser explorer sixty use support either primary browser search engine clearly frequently use also use large number search frequent advance strategy use multiple browser parallel search common information search engine usage use directly save document computer also commonly use frequency use vary lot save document self add write query infrequently use spite advance several point find information search reaccess problematic even highly experience know search engine really function laborious organize without organization difficult use time even useless use search theory simple method information practice however difficult remember query term use find information first place build find present design would
