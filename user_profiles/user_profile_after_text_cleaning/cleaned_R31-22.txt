service could use context virtual observatory envisage architecture service lower layer consist simple standard service implement data go long way towards establish modular architecture complex build upon core layer present two prototype layer architecture virtual observatory web service world wide web one introduction eleven live exponential world astronomical data grow exponential rate double approximately every year main reason trend law since data collection hardware consist base technology memory however interest note exponential trend emerge new instrument build size detector freeze point data keep accumulate constant rate thus exponential growth arise continuous construction new ever better new instrument emerge ever frequently growth data faster law prediction therefore every instrument produce steady data stream ever complex network large output data set world one cope trend first since basic process storage linearly proportional amount data technology give us also give us process disk save data per project basis task probably get easier easier first year expensive later become increasingly trivial community level however trend clear show project engage data intensive project much data archive integrate cost hardware storage community probably increase time go slightly technology use astronomy today root c emerge object orient relatively recent rarely reuse project tend write use relatively common result cost claim grow fraction project budget fifty especially true look problem perspective twelve make motivation build new sky survey make new important therefore consider new make believe new almost always make edge either need look much detect fainter object go extreme color select edge color distribution search object extreme shape gravitationally lensed arc extreme behavior infancy bob inventor postulate law utility computer network proportional square number nod number different one make matter law apply well number make fundamental enable us make new new observation sky previously unobserved new epoch astronomy enable new make utility collection independent proportional number among motivation behind build sky survey federate multiple independent project make new early today sky survey clearly prove number make first hundred square high brown dwarf clearly proportion area sky explain include possible number pairwise filter amplification combination thirteen publish scientific data generally believe scientific data publish process well understand author mostly small group create experiment provide data write paper contain data scientific print paper nowadays also make available version whose role fill organize store make available want use cite data research model work extremely well last hundred scientific data relevant research could easily include table publication paper publication model break emergence large know large data set astronomy even data particle physics similarly complex picture emerge genomic biology research many discipline clearly present data intensive science perform different fashion role author belong large like human genome project take five ten build experiment start produce data data volume large never contain small graph print data make available world archive project lifetime curation responsibility rest project collaboration move something else data either discard move national archive facility deal data many form often obtain source eager support economic model curation difficult since cost fall one group benefit another fourteen change exponential growth data source exponential growth individual data set put particular burden project make sense spend six build instrument one ready use instrument least amount time mean lifetime project data grow linear rate mean time data spend project archive move centralize facility three turn around data make national typically three old amount data double world every year three data grow thus central archive contain twelve world data one time vast majority data almost current data decentralize among data source direct consequence pattern data intensive science number course take astronomy rat may different science main remain mean project much author also large extent understand well authorship less familiar responsibility two reason many project spend large amount money basic pipeline many project experiment much effort duplicate much development waste need identify common design pattern publish curation process build general availability two web service use distribute data soap unique science issue emerge business world company need send receive lot diverse information inside corporate also outside exchange automatically read data various format hunt many finally world wide standard emerge data representation form extensible markup language clear grammatical rule encapsulate complex information form rather complex design human readable style sheet render data various easily understandable format recent relate web service standardize way invoke remote web exchange complex data indeed web service define distribute object model let us us build service major commercial agree soap simple object access protocol specify invoke talk one another exchange complex data web service description language enable application find precise call convention remote resource build compatible interface several many freely available link web service modern program hardware web service virtual observatory many expect task virtual observatory map extremely well web service already accustom various analysis package like start layer simple image process task build layer much complex process step top layer package assume data reside fit file local file system process do virtual observatory two main difference data remote result data access remote need transparent local remote data volume may huge therefore make sense move much data process near data possible many case first step process output volume dramatically smaller extract object many case data remote even exist time request may extract query create moment one carry even request data may create complex pipeline fly accord user specification like recalibration custom object detection run image build mosaic part call virtual data data create dynamically archive everything everybody believe hierarchy service answer architecture concept need extend handle remote virtual data source core set simple low level service easy implement even small project thus threshold join low large data may able implement complex service well core service combine complex talk several service create complex result design standardization access commercially build level communication task need focus astronomy specific issue need reinvent wheel need choose carefully define framework many core develop development scarce need use efficiently important emphasize would mistake try build everything everybody impossible make everybody happy choose rule many people read certain web page say ten web page view ninety system always much popular spend public money build ten possible think make ninety astrophysics community happy satisfy need build possible complex resourceful build quite complex need provide clear documentation data adopt set core service build ten system rest custom build individual efficient service save time everybody detail whether need rule irrelevant long lose sight ultimate goal create system simple use three hierarchy web service core service set web

resource sky coverage table field table physical description simple search pattern provide object within radius give point image mosaic lead part center give point standard orientation specify scale simple function filter certain unit count simple plot belong category higher level service build top atomic service perform complex task expect build days exist like today generally talk one service include resource discovery find archive optical infrared data certain part sky find archive spectra higher one angstrom resolution find overlap archive search match object satisfy certain selection criteria like brown dwarf high photometric use multicolor data one estimate statistically even distance measure use build select sample outlier find object color distribution fit pattern typical object like star normal common pattern could map well web service visualization give complex multidimensional data still best look visually brain better pattern recognition ai important create easy
