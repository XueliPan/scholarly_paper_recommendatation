present user clean usable manner ability filter network data platform able filter network packet data present specific type data request user network data object orientation intuitive analysis platform present network data user manner clean usable method interface network data analysis platform allow user use wide range analysis tool examine network data add bonus ability use computer platform would beneficial would enable sample data various source campus single computer laboratory classroom three system system network data gather platform write accept program data analysis since construct abide criteria establish system correspond accurately retrieve network data allow user focus specific data provide interface analysis user provide addition run sharp computer well use foundation read network data allow user build simple filter combine complex filter object structure use quite intuitive take closer look section foundation three packet capture library provide uniform interface underlie packet capture vary different operate system use packet analysis include ethereal also recommend start point novice network analysis writer provide programmer character array contain data packet user parse data always represent big order thus language guarantee constant size order data type better suit packet representation packet retrieval implement network class class get packet buffer class parse packet buffer use native native interface place data appropriately size data type consider header consist destination address six source address six frame type two variable amount data ignore preamble drop provide follow interface data public class public packet p constructor take unparsed packet network class argument public public public short public user could try obtain data higher level protocol example array return essentially require network essentially static perform task packet parse user design packet class design header packet take packet object immediately lower protocol constructor argument case class would take data link layer header data frame argument provide similar interface content packet system provide intuitive simple writer module student want obtain destination port packet come across network example code would look something like short port packet p e new p new e six new port network data retrieval main network listener core filter operation agent dispatcher although abstract many detail packet capture nicely hide facet network data program c especially vary size give data type even network data size term differ nearly network filter class provide filter functionality filter define graphical user interface construct use string contain filter criteria filter protocol host name port number packet length combination criteria moreover individual filter combine use thus produce composite filter filter class represent composite filter tree structure model improve efficiency filter evaluation also preserve correct order evaluation constituent filter reproduce traversal filter tree allow filter class represent composite filter size complexity user perspective filter object encapsulate filter composite filter difference exist two operation abstract class hide convolute detail thread management user provide template define custom packet analysis extend operation class implement void task method easily program define action perform arrive agent union operation filter support multiple simultaneously allow activate deactivate need manage currently present employ service class maintain list filter currently define system filter operation part zero whereas agent contain exactly one filter one operation provide manage single agent create agent change filter agent real time also provide function manage group save retrieve dispatcher provide link network layer main function check packet receive network filter active turn packet pass forward copy correspond operation figure two filter creation interface use use graphical user interface make program easy use understand also let us user experience many feature main show figure one contain five button entitle filter agent start stop help filter agent button contain function filter agent respectively start stop button control network packet flow help button contain information use provide many function filter user define filter delete filter even combine two filter composite filter figure two show snapshot filter creation process agent also many function agent create delete change stop restart rename save agent filter function perform simple procedure provide one major advantage use compare sniff program option create represent data analysis way user deem fit try minimize work user must provide operation need do write single function operation class abstract class extend system thread class data analysis module must extend operation class single function call operation run method need define operation extend access draw surface network data object main program object figure one main user interface depict example figure three figure three example component define operation execute pair filter define agent agent start operation work pass filter result consist bar graph simple counter write information file create diagram kind object use analyze network traffic four use teach tool well opportunity create provide much flexibility network sniff program many unique several ways use classroom set network analysis experimentation user access complete set network data layer iso network model stack mean protocol analysis statistics calculation possible use follow project count first module ask write class simply count categorize surprise much data go across network figure four hold example type module protocol reconstruction write reconstruct network session sort base exchange one example figure four student project protocol count conversation web page request do simply write line client request server response screen another example intrigue reconstruction protocol session real time display terminal window echo textual traffic network data sample exercise use protocol count module one simply write number log file use computer protocol walk sample data campus note different type network different subsequent discussion examine make network base type usage time day network administration many network administration tool claim detect certain network condition like traffic congestion uninvited tool work interest use detect condition administration tool many tool allow duplicate functionality module application many difficult write protocol exchange hard watch since filter build write track interpret specific network connect certain five conclusion effective tool allow protocol analysis network experimentation allow write analysis tool protocol able understand analyze network data learn much experience snoop live network data two network aware require stern warn privacy obviously privacy issue feature prominently activity involve network snoop tend focus joy possibly find illicit data rather protect network user right give instructor great opportunity network privacy snoop perspective global perspective campus computer center inform experimentation likelihood computer center snoop detection program run project may even violate campus security good
