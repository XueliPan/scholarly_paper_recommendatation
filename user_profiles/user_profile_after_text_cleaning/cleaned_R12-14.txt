error norm maximum ie whole process execute segment since split phase carry segment independently result segment may globally optimal merge phase aim avoid merge adjacent segment provide error norm merge exceed threshold determine test whole process merge phase exactly split phase except adjacent segment merge example give figure two hypothesis reject imply error norm exceed threshold merge
