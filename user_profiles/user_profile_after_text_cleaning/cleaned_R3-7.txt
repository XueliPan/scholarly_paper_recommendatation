solve problem locate expert certain query method collect combine relate information different media format organize document describe expert candidate method prove effective efficient expert find task submit run obtain best performance evaluation metric map reorganize document also significantly smaller size original corpus one introduction expert find new sub task enterprise track simulate task often appear practical enterprise search task find satisfy specific need additionally exist know list example find someone list employee name familiar middle east expert find task help find expert certain topic organization user input query topic expert find system output sort name list accord relevance query corpus use take typical type enterprise data data various like web page candidate list include name every item list exclusive like name list corporation possible solution problem retrieve document give corpus use query rank accord result document method easy carry may fit expert find much first top rank document retrieve certain query topic likely document describe topic detail document may contain information topic example article expert useful query expert find instead article describe schema relate latter one likely give higher retrieval status value use traditional second difficult method deal information lack reliable combine retrieval result different type document one two paper propose new method solve expert find problem method one work support national key foundation research development plan natural science foundation key project ministry education call document reorganization reorganize description source information candidate expert perform follow one mark appearance give corpus two extract use different rule accord corpus document type three combine get combination expert combination also document correspond entity key idea reorganization method assemble information cleanse data different document type assemble information relate candidate method reduce complexity search space strong different document type two candidate identity extraction tag important mark candidate different data source accord give name list must clarify follow candidate identity candidate may one identity could nick cell phone number identity appear document somewhere recognize appearance candidate candidate relationship candidate may different name represent usually use pair may useful identify people pair b b c know c also possible use property educe candidate candidate identity extraction start go field process mail list field contain one candidate relationship name relationship different two people merge two people new set make new candidate method get identity set make name give process sometimes difficult data quality problem corpus instance one may borrow address one spell wrong name share abbreviate name order solve several use one candidate identity less three letter highly duplicate unreliable two candidate relationship less three likely typo unreliable three name opportunity name common unreliable get candidate result possible corpus candidate identity tag first build accord use candidate extract run document process position accept backtrack find start position accept identity last replace identity mark identity like candidate id dan candidate future use elder tool like regular work optimize match large set reasonable time choose algorithm task algorithm three algorithm match set text similar algorithm run time worst case n length text total length main principle algorithm build run text obtain result however task require match smith smith algorithm must handle space carefully reason backtrack require algorithm know smith end whether end end smith must backtrack find begin identity last candidate may overlap strategy accept one end latest throw three document reorganization reorganization description document mean reorganize document information different source extract information may description among candidate identity document combine form one document variety data source information extraction different time also necessary find potential description characteristic document experiment data source corpus composition follow accord four figure one data type corpus see mainly three type document corpus web page web web text cod process web page task little information obtain cod text process purpose step get rid redundant information extract information future use take page list corpus perform process one parse document valid web format document two take body field web format document pass several filter order extract certain field like field subject field date field three body text extract tag strip final result combination step two three lie format mail mail store accord generate file mail archive follow point important first encode text vary might serious problem process document however several name handle encode correctly may miss fortunately character simply parse document supplemental point encode also matter example entity character e program decode must do next step second quite complex problem extract mail field page field include mail subject date mail body generate page store field variety format similar general various detail way handle problem pass text set filter filter handle one case filter may sub handle one two field filter case way make problem easy strike use case case method last several trivial point must clear must mark mail position thread do use document tree id file generate bob strip reply mail body mean line start order reduce redundant additionally also pick paragraph candidate identity appear web page process extract information document candidate mark occurrence candidate page use follow source form document candidate description name description document one title document two head line one head line two bold character line nearest occurrence position three window information content around occurrence position candidate four group information specific treatment useful web page merge web page information mail information anchor text together difficulty lie set range window wide window may contain useless even wrong information side narrow window may lose information first try set range default value however result coarse reliable try several value train last retrieve ten word ahead ten word position window information web page corpus find phenomena name always appear group group description individual group find group information retrieve group information corpus group information frequently find great helpful however accuracy base whether name entity identify ignore forget mark name entity group may part group information lose mislead change data structure greatly reduce index amount group information improve result high level information extraction special web page special page may contain information page special page process actually structurally analysis do page information people extract like position four experiment result table contain result comparative experiment use method directly find candidate identity first n document return rank candidate weight return document best
