four leave p one notably difficult task compare search behavior observe study report study use longer query query per session spend slightly longer search result page one possible reason study include one task type close informational query chi exploratory ga specifically include hard task navigational informational task likely easier bring overall query session metrics user response close informational task real task people use search although search presumably good help people task fail time time interestingly overall frequency use advance smaller study report fourteen task fail usage comparable number report possible overall use advance less frequently view support number report white morris find log data query contain common advance plausible since search seem work well without seven learn type simple query rarely use complex unless really struggle study focus search task type namely close informational search task possible find apply specific task type example hard imagine formulate question query open informational search task goal simply learn something topic however also possible less frustrate task goal try find specific piece information obvious succeed less task probably learn something along way frustration might common thus since goal understand behavioral signal could use determine frustrate feel close task least good place start specifically control evaluate familiarity search generally domain know affect search domain presumably easier time think alternative ways refine query original query fail give satisfactory result study large number search task cover wide variety domain unlikely systematic effect result research need study whether different level domain show different behavioral signal successful unsuccessful task participate either laboratory study level motivation different would task try find information personal use make either way maybe normally life close informational task random information find easily user give without display frustrate discover clear laboratory clearly want find answer become agitate could find whatever general type give vary find relate expert relate success search task difficult make direct comparison current find study focus however find suggest begin search task start resemble example study show fail query refinement process become unsystematic field al eight aula three report unsystematic refinement typical strategy less successful also find spend longer time search result page fail task resemble behavior less experience another study two suggest exhaustive evaluation style common less experience strategy seem relate less successful search white suggest likely use navigator type systematic task variable behavior complex task analysis different white thus clear search trail fail task would typically resemble however data suggest struggle search task even task task behavior become vary potentially future research focus systematically study search trail whether search trail provide information whether user succeed fail search task analysis study data restrict use time stamp along rat lab study observe possible signal may relate user become frustrate search frustrate unsure proceed task often scroll result page land page seemingly random fashion clear intention actually read page another potential signal might relate user become somewhat desperate start revisit page already visit session signal potentially trackable real time future work study specifically focus measurable behavioral signal indicate struggle search task result important addition exist body research focus successful expert demonstrate combination smaller scale lab study study chi exploratory ga complement former provide hypotheses latter quantitative support hypotheses generalizable data set study show signal available real time user least close informational search task signal together signal relate successful less successful search discover research could use build model would predict user satisfaction search session model turn could use gain better understand often leave search unhappy often frustrate need help perhaps intervention point search
