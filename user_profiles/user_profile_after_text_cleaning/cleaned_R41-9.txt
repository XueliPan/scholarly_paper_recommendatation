educate guess graphical authentication scheme interaction institute hong interaction institute information network institute mellon university mellon university mellon university abstract paper investigate security graphical authentication educate guess attack result two user study indicate use original authentication authentication vulnerable educate guess attack result also demonstrate mitigate vulnerability use distort picture one introduction educate guess attack attack authentication password attacker try guess authentication base particular educate guess attack categorize two type first type educate guess attacker exploit knowledge common many instance attacker know frequently choose word password actual password try password higher chance success try random sequence letter guess user password context authentication type educate guess generally call dictionary attack different type educate guess attack rely knowledge information specific give user instance attacker know user wife name pam attacker guess pam slight string considerably higher probability user password possible sequence analogy terminology use characterize attack call latter form educate guess spear educate guess attack one possible solution educate guess attack improve memorability use authentication scheme however educate guess still one foreseeable attack graphical authentication preserve information semantic mean image authentication graphical authentication could actually less resilient spear educate guess attack first research question address paper quantify extent graphical authentication resilient vulnerable spear educate guess attack consider graphical variant dictionary attack attacker try guess user authentication base general knowledge specifically people bias toward specific type image face choose authentication attacker may use bias improve chance guess right authentication second research question address paper prove disprove existence bias toward certain type image graphical authentication choose characterize bias exist one countermeasure educate guess attack graphical authentication scheme use distortion two three al show high memorability distort picture three claim system therefore secure however study thus far quantify much add security distortion provide thus third research question extent distortion technique improve security authentication scheme figure one authentication system use first user study user ask choose predetermine three image image authenticate first user study ask guess friend graphical authentication use interface quantify vulnerability graphical authentication educate guess attack impact distortion attack two user study two user study order investigate three research question conduct first user study recruit friend pair define friend pair two meet three time week register ask friend pair guess graphical authentication word ask mock guess authentication target know well ie spear educate guess attack target either friend stranger additionally authentication original distort table one show success rat mock four condition table one show original condition success rat higher random guess result demonstrate use original authentication guess authentication higher success rate random guess especially high success rate condition indicate graphical authentication vulnerable spear educate guess attack hand distort condition statistical significance success rat success rate random guess p one original distort friend eight one stranger twenty three zero zero table one success rat educate guess asterisk denote success rat higher statistically success rate random guess number parentheses stand number mock fifteen make correct guess demonstrate distort picture resilient educate guess attack picture second user study test whether bias toward certain among picture choose authentication ask two set picture twelve accord semantic mean image first set consist randomly choose use script select post creative commons license one set consist choose graphical authentication first user study compare two set categorize evaluate whether choose bias toward certain use mechanical turk categorize image accord semantic mean twelve table two show categorize twelve ratio pi one two three twelve calculate pi n denote number categorize category total number transportation landscape category human animal insect interior random choice choice six seven one zero ten ten one eleven nine zero one seventeen none four two five zero four fifteen three four zero thirteen three zero sixty three two clothe object build plant food total table two distribution give original image number parentheses stand actual number category tag give asterisk denote statistically random choice choice table two number random choice column show categorization people take hand number normal choice column show categorization choose authentication number two indicate tendency choose choose image authentication table two show less likely choose transportation food authentication hand likely choose landscape plant build authentication result indicate bias authentication contrary ask mechanical turk categorize distort picture statistically difference randomly choose image user choose image observation imply attacker launch dictionary attack graphical authentication without distortion mitigate vulnerability three discussion result obtain paper yield number interest first inevitable security memorability graphical authentication result imply semantic mean authentication help attacker make better guess authentication semantic mean also help user memorize easily second result show semantic mean distort difficult guess without know original thus use distortion make information asymmetry user attacker asymmetry give user clear advantage attacker finally result apply type graphical instance secret picture use bank sit verify web sit legitimate although need investigation would able use distort photo secret picture make difficult guess attacker keep secret picture easy memorize user four conclusion paper evaluate security graphical authentication educate guess attack find discuss paper provide evidence graphical authentication challenge authentication password allow choose password tend choose weak however time find suggest address problem use distortion use distort make graphical authentication secure educate guess attack keep memorability high original three generally hope paper suggest new direction improve security graphical rely advantage human cognitive process rather address memorability limitation use graphics five reference one creative commons two user authentication system use schema visual memory proceed six page japan three e r n use illusion secure authentication usable anywhere proceed usable privacy security august
