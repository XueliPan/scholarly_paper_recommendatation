enterprise track one fu tong min state key laboratory intelligent technology national laboratory information science technology department computer science technology university china abstract participate document search expert search enterprise track motive behind enterprise track study issue search document inside enterprise environment sufficiently address research document search focus key overview page link analysis expert search develop detect expert experiment base previous model one introduction third year group university participate enterprise track different previous track introduce new enterprise corpus new task approach study year include link analysis among document person entity identification topic distillation key resource result combination document search task mainly investigate effect key source link analysis among document first observe high quality resource distribution feature study find overview page also link analysis hit employ evaluate page quality besides attempt novel link analysis method involve document similarity expert find task lot make name identification build personal description document candidate various type obtain retrieve result description document collection help em algorithm combine result different corpus generate merge rank list two document search task document search define retrieve document help science communicator create overview page give topic area tend authoritative page project document dedicate topic rather page make pass mention topic two potential approach find overview page first one build query independent classifier select document specific feature require key page one adapt link analysis predict authoritative page approach attempt experiment key page use query independent feature retrieval key page first retrieval query relevant page whole corpus mine overview page however volume whole corpus large may take much time retrieve therefore try data cleanse work pick key page accord query independent feature example page provide overview page browse notice overview page similar many many internal link similar design layout however believe recognize overview exactly accord template layout robust try build classifier select overview page use feature like amount one support national key foundation research development plan natural science foundation national high technology project figure one show distribution amount overview page provide distribution notice overview page contain lot contrast fact among whole corpus ninety percent page less conduct experiment retrieve document number use example overview page relevant page result show performance ten higher retrieve whole corpus size select corpus ten whole one figure one distribution amount example page similarly make hypothesis overview page authoritative may link hub page therefore anchor text may provide much useful navigational information experiment result validate supposition anchor text base retrieval outperform full text retrieval twenty map feature also attempt identify overview page length page amount also implement decision tree combine feature better construct overview page corpus finally performance result retrieve document set distillation achieve improvement full text collection adapt link analysis find authoritative page authority page active area research estimate authority web page inside enterprise open question since difference amount web page corpus link structure whether previous link analysis hit page rank effective need explore first use page rank one estimate quality web page however link structure web site quite different environment algorithm apply execute page rank process get page large score like index page however difficult use importance score conjunction score rank query result several know approach attempt fail improve performance another famous link analysis algorithm try hit two idea intuitive parallel find overview page although page high authority score overview page hard combine score content base score try use em three aggregate linear combination improvement trivial overview page want find less good authoritative page mean require overview page link important page good page also link therefore give page add page link page new score reflect idea consider similarity page instead merely analyze link relation example hub point authoritative page hub page good one authoritative may get lot reinforcement however little part hub page relevant page link authoritative page may get much plus strength link relation less reflect anchor text therefore involve similarity anchor text algorithm may better quantitatively determine strength reinforcement experiment result show improvement achieve link analysis consistent significant evaluation result year document search task use page relevant result train total submit four run list table one official result document search run anchor text full text select map select however performance result much anticipation reason lie first document retrieve much less retrieve whole collection pool process may document run cover second train set use consist example page may overfit due small scale three expert search previous expert search task one main difference master list system automatically detect find expert address name make lot person name entity recognition year another important difference accurate make previous set relevant small want see main contact query list ten knowledgeable people set quite make sense require us design better rank expert detection master list automatically detect expert accord guideline among pattern extract address corpus include variation symbol may total get address eliminate typo name name address get candidate name address name give name least five possible f f first three pattern variation use algorithm label take time length name n length document label problem bite hard tackle possible one person share one abbreviation example may represent among ambiguous try eliminate ambiguity accord label name however still ambiguous hard eliminate eliminate also integrate system construct merge result previous expert find task build person description document candidate four extract candidate relevant information document example context around expert identifier besides also extract information candidate total find amount name construct detail two build one anchor text key overview page corpus describe document search section merge rank result retrieve collection try em algorithm assign weight rank similarity ratio weight parallel ratio map achieve rank list merge list achieve best performance five year expert search task submit four run list table two result show official result expert search run evaluation result effectiveness combination size window forty linear combination combination four four discussion future work map document search task attempt promise link analysis algorithm find link structure totally different therefore try investigate link analysis apply bigger ambition would like experiment link analysis algorithm bigger data set propose algorithm integrate link analysis similarity rank expert find task past two propose rank model propagation algorithm focus social network analysis year build different collection different corpus generate different confidence
