adaptive explanatory visualization evaluation university pa peter university pa abstract adaptive visualization explanatory visualization suggest two approach increase educational effectiveness visualization paper present work integration adaptive explanatory visualization introduce motivation behind research describe adaptive explanatory visualization implement system visualize process expression evaluation c program language simulation model type combine visual education computer information science education computer science education adaptive visualization adaptive program visualization user model expression evaluation one introduction visualization powerful educational aid however even visualization find fail help understand subject matter al al one approach suggest increase educational effectiveness visualization adaptive visualization adaptive visualization base assumption student may unequal level knowledge different program algorithm visualize theory behind adaptive visualization inversely match level detail visualization student level knowledge lower student understand construct detail relate visualization approach allow student focus least understand still able understand whole picture early study simple confirm adaptive visualization improve student understand visualization recently develop system explore value visualization context c program language several classroom study bring encourage result eighty class find system adaptive helpful helpful current work extend stream work attempt combine adaptive visualization complementary approach

explanatory visualization idea explanatory visualization augment every visualization step natural language al study demonstrate indeed help understand see new system attempt truly integrate adaptive visualization framework simply add static text rather produce adapt user level knowledge two expression evaluation tool study c language introductory program course successor system address problem explain expression evaluation exclude pointer arithmetic problem relatively complicate rarely address visualization tool support cover simple arithmetic comparison logic assignment domain model consist model explicit four implicit implicit one read variable two implicit cast three cast four logical value representation zero evaluate false nonzero value evaluate true implicit relevant one operator user interface figure one divide four progress b navigation c blackboard progress area contain list explicit along progress know allow student monitor progress student knowledge implicit visualize although track use adaptation purpose area allow student select expression evaluate set initial value select mode navigation area allow student go evaluation process basis either forward backward finally blackboard area evaluation take place present system work two exploration ex knowledge evaluation ex mode student present order evaluation evaluation evaluation operator current expression take several step mode student role narrow navigate observe visualization read mode interactive first student ask indicate correct order evaluation shape precedence operator expression ask predict outcome value serve two purpose train test separation also present student model level couple may find difficult one logical value representation two implicit cast three implicit cast four dedicate visual flag blackboard area flag highlight eventually collapse mention previous section construct short paragraph text paragraph tag value student knowledge level exceed value paragraph longer show many paragraph value assign therefore several may disappear time eventually student already master operator paragraph show example first paragraph operator explain mean decrement variable student see paragraph first three time evaluate knowledge level indicate idea paragraph remember therefore paragraph exclude explanation however couple incorrect answer mode provide evidence fact student may misunderstand idea paragraph become visible speed knowledge accumulation model system function concept complexity assign concept domain complex concept lower assumption knowledge

adaptation student learn concept need less less guidance master concept need guidance overly detail may discourage bore student force see already know nothing ever change system student may conclude already learn know adjust visualization match student current knowledge use overlay student model concept model describe term two system ex follow four student activity type log student model one student observe visualization two student correctly indicate order evaluation three student provide correct outcome value operation four student provide incorrect outcome value operation history student use make current level knowledge drive system adaptation engine student knowledge level relate certain concept increase relate gradually become faster faster level complexity assign advance
