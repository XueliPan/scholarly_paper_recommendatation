work web valuable source computer science al frequent use web well computer enable people use creatively information search show formulate query multiple search term refine query frequently use many browser retain context search also use file system service store temporary final result also use find function frequently surprisingly order result default operator two seven computer science participate work average active web use average rat experience information mean scale one ten observe interview search tell use tool would normally use could finish session whenever want thirty

advance search feature phrase new window result save link separate find locate search term copy paste search term default operator order result four six five one one one one important advance use follow save link result one participant collect organize material find later use search see process document first collect afterwards document read detail four use one use separate text file one file system store link comment usually search task like go large number search result quickly result file save computer page collect link next phase start read content result page open new four open result page new browser window see good memory aid strategy also comment easily ten open time soon system would collapse system run many open browser use find command two frequently use find function quickly locate search term document see context appear term two commonly enter search term use copy paste action example title article web page copy paste search field comment start common search term find something base common term start use term find result surprise result way work none know use default operator two correct idea result order say understand first try find document search term show one term four support different level information search phase search process suggest four search user one suggest search term indicate experience use search term less experience usually term add copy paste function search interface facilitate formulate accurate query suggest term two explain natural language powerful search tool even expert default use search explain natural language use would presumably become easier three provide search history leave open result formulate new query new browser do make easy go back lead find search interface facilitate search process maintain user four facilitate evaluation result use find order quickly see context search term occur document highlight user context search term appear document could find effortlessly implement search interface demonstrate figure one leave list cluster automatically generate result cluster form group result share word phrase use filter result list cluster help evaluate accuracy large result set guideline four provide fast way access result even far result list select cluster user see result contain select systematic test functionality currently ongoing first test show effective method access relevant document long result list efficiently accurately figure one enhance search interface list menu addition give easy access relevant result cluster serve possible additional search term guideline one term cluster add query menu require forbid term guideline two also implement method rewrite query natural language user check query interpret correctly guideline two example user could formulate query information visualization scientific visualization map search user interface translate query natural language show user interpretation query search document either phrase information visualization scientific visualization word map occur anywhere document currently interface history function store query make one search session box guideline three future plan provide enhance history function store query important web page also make easy organize search history five discussion seven claim reveal even efficient expert exist anyhow show make information search efficient fluent claim also benefit give appropriate user interface support design propose ways satisfy purpose advance use include interface feature support search process search history easier evaluation search result result cluster highlight search term well feature make easier formulate query also translate query natural language success propose feature currently evaluate empirical study work support graduate school
