click find result button user simply wait query submit user also encounter problem notice typo miss space word thus understand result retrieve interview overall positive praise simplicity clarity result presentation whereas see use many colour present much information seem complex use different colour blue black black green female seventy although familiar felt much easier feel messy colour constantly wonder collect many word female two experience find miss useful functionality provide namely cache option option select language return result one use exclusively cache document opinion main benefit cache search term highlight especially longer document find helpful use comment miss functionality felt information would easier find language option important well acquaint one experience user comment issue interview although language use one less experience participant face problem language option search give result many different however miss language four seven aula selection aware option acquire information document interview last three inexperienced web understand immediately recognize word icon correctly infer would happen correspond result would click contrast face try distinguish word document result list problem pronounce one occasion user saw term word title result thus automatically think word document however result actually point file familiar document thus icon help understand nature document icon excel hand although familiar actual use recognize icon also computer discussion least experience face considerably usability search engine use suggest use search beneficial possibly even necessary successful search find true younger see pollock although face less experience might prevent find information still presume without support may make feel confuse even incapable use search promisingly face forty percent less problematic furthermore different type two mostly relate understand happen make feel anxious control situation believe due inexperience well cognitive decline learn remember new younger people typically learn use school people many older learn use home without support readily available situation easily make computer use feel frighten aula press induce negative negative turn decrease motivation use main challenge relate understand many difficult understand even difficult explain especially explain novice user simply want find interest information understand technical detail behind avoid task explain cache page cryptic file mean simply omit see worry result understand work different relate use standard interaction style try type text text box without focus expect query submit without click appropriate button seem confuse annoy expect due lack use standard interaction expect ease experience believe also alleviate interface design explain later font text box query space letter clear text box button find helpful none edit text hand frequent usability problem one reason unquestionably lack experience use keyboard backspace delete confuse mouse keep mouse still click however psychomotor also add problem make difficult perform fine motor especially target small try position cursor two letter letter letter space help problem provide target point provide select functionality thus aim provide older simple interface however simplistic design always risk take simplicity far actually reduce usability important functionality miss generally result prove simplistic design successful like face considerably less usability compare however important miss important language selection speak although one participant value cache option find distract possible remedy situation would replace technical term cache simpler term text version point cache version term might easier understand computer provide benefit search term highlight advance search think option possibly ignore less experience however two elderly click advance search link accident one participant click type query try submit query link advance search page understand mean exact phrase know get back normal search page without assistance another user think need click advance search link enter term query click advance search link understand mean write additional term mean suggestion helpful example typo search term study however typically query one user query term replace another term fit context thus make sense user experience user understand suggestion system work easy ignore text however distract less experience document page unexpected understand happen example acrobat reader start five seven aula click file one experience user also accidentally click word file comment accident immediately file start load although immediately know happen might choose open document notice type click version also problematic one user accidentally click version understand result page look strange design help problem find work none accidentally open file require external also inexperienced could immediately recognize least interview problem forget click focus text box type text common previous study aula press alleviate problem make focus feedback pronounce grey box text box provide thick border black text focus text box nevertheless focus even common one reason focus automatically put text box clear text box button click correct technical detail would alleviate much focus addition remember take mouse pointer top box attempt edit text forget click mouse button order get focus text box alleviate tool tip text click mouse button insert text mouse pointer text box information relate previous search sometimes confuse new search confusion cause mistake evaluate number return result one participant type part query notice wrong result list go main page type query alleviate confusion might beneficial provide clear start point new search natural start point would main page would distract information previous search although logos work link main page start point make evident separate begin new search button next version clear information previous search thus provide natural start point new search task quest search study show simple design make search experience less problematic manageable older two study conduct far current study aula press also highlight importance observe action although several already tell us use easy language possible simply come easy language without thoroughly understand target understand use understand goal simplistic interface replace elaborate instead provide older possibility choose simple interface manipulate learn use web gain experience may find elaborate better suit need however long feel interface full extra confuse less experience people like may find safe learn environment conclude main learn study follow older benefit simple lessen cause understand happen decrease number feature learn importantly make feel control situation feature include simplify design need consider carefully important exclude
