new authentication abstract paper discuss evaluate two novel user authentication aim prevent observation attack improve usability previous work reduce authentication time suitable portable mobile one background motivation ability authenticate crucial modern information instance mobile phone place ensure person use device legitimate owner unauthorized bank terminal need ability establish person use give bank card holder correspond account however user authentication rely vulnerable observation attack observation attack unauthorized party record action legitimate user perform authenticate later reuse record information impersonate user common instance observation attack impostor snoop shoulder legitimate user enter password successfully capture besides observation prove successful include photo capture distance one audio record keyboard click sound two video three even biometric replication four previous work three argue novel line defense observation attack instead try conceal user input hide authentication challenge present think authentication session exchange password buddy far focus try hide answer buddy postulate hide part question usable secure effect break challenge question two part first part challenge convey visible observable channel second part challenge convey hide channel user mentally reassemble part answer reassemble challenge authentication system verify answer combine knowledge correct response send channel conceptually instead ask password ask aloud password contain visible challenge whisper user ear tell lie tell truth hide challenge user answer yes outsider unable observe whisper ear user answer give clue whether password either indeed password tell tell truth password instruct tell lie case indistinguishable observer important

indicate outperform older system pin allow faster authentication graphical fig three b give error rat different authentication evidence prototype perform well especially pin contrast rather high error rat possible reason apparent superiority audio mechanism would lie one lack familiarity tactile device two cognitive combine finger palm security standpoint compare mechanism novel inadvertently reveal authentication point screen less frequently however longer audio signal could partially hear despite use headset audio signal thus need keep brief possible secure four conclusion reference report pilot study two novel authentication rely different hide channel design use vibrate slightly faster mechanism expense possibly higher error rat use audio hide channel allow faster
