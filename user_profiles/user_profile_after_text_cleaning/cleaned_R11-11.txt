query monitor distribute business process tutorial milo university milo one introduction business process short consist group business undertake one pursuit particular goal usually operate distribute environment implement fairly complex facilitate design deployment execution particular recent standard business process execution language provide language describe interface process well full operational logic process execution flow automatically compile executable code implement describe run application server process execution trace behavior record standard format new simplify development interestingly information management perspective also provide important new mine information query extremely hard impossible evaluate logic cod complex program potentially much easier give declarative specification furthermore sophisticate query interleave static analysis specification process monitor use variety critical task fraud detection sla service level agreement maintenance general business management provide essential infrastructure company optimize business process reduce operational cost ultimately increase competitiveness goal study new new generation bring process

process graph data activity nod connect control flow edge design automatically convert turn automatically compile executable code implement describe mention declarative greatly simplify task development interestingly information management perspective also provide important new mine information consider instance user try understand particular business say web auction system operate may want find answer question place bid without give first credit card detail one confirm purchase kind credit service use auction system directly indirectly ie process interact answer query become feasible give declarative specification like organization access well ability answer query possibly distribute environment great practical potential support query one need adequate query language efficient execution engine argue essential develop query allow intuitive formulation query efficient query evaluation distribute environment five fourteen specification describe potential behavior instance actual run process follow logic describe specification include specific real action actual data management allow trace process instance perform message send receive activity value performance metrics send information standard format log fly monitor often call literature bam business activity monitor get intuition type monitor give may require consider web auction system mention system administrator would like among guarantee fair play detect track service usage performance may achieve monitor run process ask instance notify whenever auctioneer cancel bid often attempt confirm bid without give first credit detail may also want inform whenever average response time give service pass certain threshold fix problem switch backup general monitor encompass track run time particular pattern execution path individual process interaction different process well provision statistics performance one process one also query log mine activity pattern observe query potential behavior monitor actual run process instance complementary query specification use focus part require conversely use complement analysis process statically determine query specification argue important develop gracefully combine query run time behavior log comprehensive analysis six since general particular promise brilliant future believe important develop solid foundation query monitor process thereby provide essential infrastructure company optimize business process reduce operational cost gain visibility key performance ultimately increase competitiveness three query depend context user may interest query one structure specification two behavior process define refer query structural behavioral query resp consider example specification describe auction system run example engineer may wish query specification find process follow certain code pattern say loop contain operation example structural query system analyst may hand wish know whether system allow perform unbounded sequence bid regardless sequence implement loop recursion else example behavioral query two class query typically categorize literature invariance intuitively two one execution consider simulation execution query language logic l invariant evaluation formula f l system r equivalent evaluation f r r previous research address class query separately follow program verification work area program verification focus behavioral query vast amount work general area program analysis verification see eleven sample specifically analysis composite web service process sixteen eleven fifteen seven one work typically base modal calculus invariant query formulate logic test run program satisfy behavioral property verification behavioral typically high complexity simple undecidable general case dedicate optimization data structure develop accelerate process query may abstractly view set nest graph possibly recursion graph structure capture execution flow process nest come fact use process necessarily atomic may complex internal structure may represent graph recursion may exist due mutual call research offer query data general tree data particular typical query sensitive exact graph structure invariant twelve

process expect behavior efficient query process transparent management distribute data four monitor five reference management allow trace process instance perform message send receive activity value performance metrics send information monitor tool often call literature bam business activity monitor nine four twenty report standard format enable typical monitor compose three layer layer absorb stream come execution engine process filter layer select relevant automatically trigger action dashboard allow follow process progress view custom report statistics process send alert also log available rather powerful exist tool dedicate monitor mine process analysis interleave static analysis specification analysis stream generate process instance possible use exist tool contrast use uniform query query static stream data common system three mention send monitor standard format also write natural question use couple exist engine eighteen task already mention limitation query general particular query process also best fit monitor trace key observation stream describe individual event express even simple inquiry process execution flow one need write fairly complex query perform excessive number join difficult impossible handle exist stream furthermore even nest representation reflect flow choose data standard stream process would still adequate task stream manage data dags direct acyclic graph typical structure process trace importantly expect receive tree document order ie leave right process sibling branch sequentially flow necessarily follow order parallel may interleave defer process incoming give process branch sibling process may unnecessary delay dedicate parallel process require believe adequate solution may achieve combine best feature exist
