result approach scale open web heterogeneous document unlimited set must cover successfully retrieve information secondly provide semantic document rank model semantic typically provide search may better semantic data retrieval rather semantic information retrieval search return ontology instance rather document generally rank method provide link document reference instance add interface four neither instance document rank may sufficient small knowledge base scale properly massive document search typically return result therefore perform well retrieval space large work report part effort experiment open semantic search constrain specific organizational often case today exploit combination scale information space provide semantic web specifically report experiment new system build upon two semantic search approach complementary first draw system fourteen search heterogeneous knowledge base generate answer natural language query second system report three support semantic search base formal domain knowledge world wide web document semantic search system exploit knowledge base complement two ways relevant exist provide answer provide documentary evidence help user judge validity answer alternatively provide answer example semantic markup available topic user still get answer form relevant document important feature use relevant semantic data draw semantic web available information find standard web page answer user query provide innovative flexible solution problem integrate data find two source dynamically create link web page semantic markup degrade gracefully semantic markup available incomplete therefore propose approach practical way exploit grow amount semantic markup available semantic web potentially enhance current search technology world wide web research present thus aim make step towards design semantic retrieval scale open web bridge gap semantic web data b bridge gap semantic web data textual information available web address first aim provide natural language interface onto heterogeneous semantic data work report three address second aim make ordinary web page open semantic search rest paper follow propose system architecture describe section two section three explain system make possible get answer semantic web section four describe semantic web data use enhance retrieval process information report evaluation system section five compare simple search query expansion method draw section six two system architecture figure one depict two main step overall retrieval process first step aim bridge gap user retrieve

rank relevant document base previously retrieve piece ontological knowledge exact answer user query retrieve system perform second step retrieve web document phase address two describe section one document retrieve without domain restriction b automatically index term ontology retrieve rank use semantic model could potentially scale large document step carry use four main architectural one ontology index module available semantic information two module answer query form ontology triple three annotator module generate index semantic document four document retrieval rank module retrieve rank document relevant ontology triple obtain output system consist set ontology answer user question complementary rank list relevant document three bridge gap semantic web user first step system rely exploit semantic data unlike predecessor fifteen derive answer single ontology perform multiple part new generation tool dynamically reuse combine information draw heterogeneous eighteen figure two detail consist three main show figure two first linguistic component detail fifteen use gate five translate query linguistic triple identify triple relate term together instance example query translate rock group nirvana second fourteen map term linguistic triple semantically relevant ontology section finally triple similarity service section select ontological triple best represent user query answer generate triple list instance algorithm map algorithm map linguistic term draw different output set entity map table correspond one linguistic term table contain ontology different term match see table one ontology discovery identify run time set likely provide information request user take advantage knowledge provide entire real time currently integrate tool gateway six however integration yet complete time carry experiment report paper therefore rely large amount semantic data gather directly index use semantic index base entity local name label property optionally ontology property second index level also generate contain taxonomical information semantic entity make use level index search approximate syntactic entity match real one time broaden search space bridge gap user ontology terminology use term linguistic triple also relate word obtain moreover initiate spread activation search across ie find owl example compound rock group nirvana produce unless split part linguistic triple split nirvana rock nirvana group nirvana table one entity map table example rock two music three foo bar rock class exact one rock stone material rock two three garden rock class set possible syntactic identify semantic enrichment filter determine sense map enough information available discard semantically inappropriate semantic similarity triple term distinct compute take account mean give place hierarchy ontology use methodology evaluate ten therefore determine map rock material stone parent substance genre music music ontology parent map rock garden ontology garden feature rock parent garden discard semantically valid match rock triple similarity service triple similarity service completely novel module invoke linguistic terminology meaningfully map element level individual spread several entity map table ontology analyze ontology compliant triple link create step return small set jointly cover user query output represent triple map table relate linguistic triple equivalent ontological triple obtain different finally ontology triple relate actual instance use generate answer select give priority contain match individual term linguistic triple table two triple map table example show city city state state two three relation similarity service inspect identify entity cover select ontology way appropriate linguistic triple result linguistic triple map one ontology triple may represent complete alternative linguistic triple partial combine briefly illustrate query show table two contain match relation find rather typical case either linguistic relation implicit example ontology relation label difficult detect syntactic therefore problem become one find link two term ie city find inspect find either algorithm investigate existence indirect ie city state state unlike previous example algorithm identify set valid candidate map candidate map match join triple control domain range information many case need complete triple nirvana translate ontological triple musician nirvana translate query rock group nirvana ontological triple nirvana nirvana rock nirvana group note nirvana rock group produce relevant ontological triple four bridge gap semantic web web second step system rely work report three provide user rank web document system significantly extend enhance present work deal scenario particular annotation weight section completely novel adaptation traditional model use rank process section evolve previous work build query input ontology retrieve phase annotate document introduce section one research aim integration data find information available standard web page order enhance performance current web search key step achieve aim lie link semantic space content space mean explicit annotation document semantic dynamic change annotation must do flexible way solution explore paper require link web page semantic markup contrary create dynamically way two information source may remain achieve adapt traditional task generate ontology base conceptual index index need enable real time query answer current web search view semantic search similarly rely conceptual index properly scale large document similarly traditional rank base weight approach rely measure relevance individual association semantic web document give assumption problem lie achieve annotation process generate conceptual index efficient dynamic way potentially scale web overall annotation process consist follow step one extract process semantic web web information typically semantic data web document crawl populate index evaluation web document come collection web document generate standard index use two extract textual representation semantic ontology analyze semantic order find document likely associate semantic entity usually define one textual ontology make process assume lexical present ontology multiple value local name label property entity example individual entity describe apple company could label apple apple note single textual representation share different semantic textual representation apple share fruit company three find set potential document annotate identify semantic entity apple apple search index use standard search rank process order find document potentially associate four extract semantic context entity find document may contain ambiguous mean entity may find document reference entity apple fruit instead company name address issue exploit ontological define context entity set directly link ontology explicit hence example context entity apple may contain company technology five find semantically document set semantically relate process extract textual search index set document extract step take set semantically document six generate final intersection previous set candidate document set semantically document provide us set document likely contain concept also set document likely contain contextual mean concept set document identify new annotation create semantic entity document seven weight system assign weight reflect well semantic represent mean document weight compute automatically rank document previously extract step three five step three extract rank list document textual representation semantic entity obtain list document correspond score use create final unique rank list use fusion methodology report eight list contain score document potentially generate new annotation do step five obtain list document contextual concept list fuse obtain final list semantically document filter document discuss step six final list document score l compute l represent relevance semantic represent relevance contextual mean value obtain conduct experiment set four score obtain l assign weight generate six summary approach take advantage traditional model dynamically link semantic data document approach provide weight schema base generate use later semantic search rank process retrieve rank document approach present slightly modification three work traditional model semantically adapt replace traditional query document semantic query document query vector represent importance semantic entity information need express user document vector represent relevance semantic entity within document generate query vector document retrieval system take input piece ontological knowledge previously retrieve response query phase generate document
