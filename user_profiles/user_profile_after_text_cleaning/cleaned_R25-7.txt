however previously mention develop consumer service thus still need analyse mobile business service use work context network nature mobile work system require user acceptance usability measure combine objective subjective measure usability research often report result relation three factor usability mention iso standard thirteen namely satisfaction efficiency effectiveness however construct often report separately one system report efficient whereas relation effectiveness result differ subjective satisfaction often use give additional testimony superiority one interface reasonable question whether different usability need study whether one would sufficient effectiveness efficiency subjective satisfaction point direction maybe enough simply cheaply ask user much like service use score indication usability service levy review study conclude although clear association subjective satisfaction task performance still many case prefer measurably worse later al show three usability dependent application domain user experience use context simple correlation three expect especially complex nonroutine task efficiency measure usability useless task completion effectiveness take account also encourage measurement three usability subjective objective however limit subjective measure subjective satisfaction instead many objective measure task time also evaluate subjectively objective task time system may faster system b perceive time may well faster system b result warrant dependent situation overall result give important information usability system three measure productivity widely agree general impact output company thus productivity productivity multidimensional term mean vary depend context use productivity define simply output divide input use generate output input consist labour capital energy forth output consist service information section provide overview exist tool measure productivity company addition measure productivity improvement result use mobile business service discuss traditional productivity measurement traditionally productivity measure either total productivity measure partial productivity measure measurement total productivity ie compare output input difficult different type output input sum compare directly therefore partial productivity measure commonly use partial productivity ratio calculate divide total output one input portion input labour productivity common example kind measure usually use measure impact labour productivity ratio calculate divide total output number labour input moreover indirect productivity measurement use data need partial productivity measure available idea behind indirect productivity measure certain phenomena relate productivity include example high defect rat machine defect unused capacity high material scrap unnecessary transport poor atmosphere long wait time thirty indirect productivity measure focus factor closely relate productivity use explain reason behind change productivity accord al problem productivity measure take account change quality input output especially service business quality productivity deal separately moreover measure effect mobile business service productivity traditional measure may difficult business process change indirect influence improve customer satisfaction service example note information technology investment may create intangible assets turn may positive impact productivity company include traditional include intangible could provide accurate realistic view return result investment four advance interaction subjective productivity measurement use traditional productivity measurement present require collect quantitative data sometimes input output easily quantifiable may difficult even impossible collect data need productivity measurement example service work input output usually intangible quality may vary lot case subjective productivity measurement one possible method collect need information level productivity subjective productivity measure base personnel subjective data usually collect use survey interview see traditional objective productivity measure also subjective measure direct indirect direct productivity measure example partial productivity objective survey question regard productivity subjective indirect productivity measure example unused capacity unnecessary transport long wait time objective survey question concern wait time need subjective subjective measurement also common way measure usability could provide basis combine usability productivity addition could good way include intangible quality measure productivity impact mobile business service four explore success factor mobile business service main aim paper study factor effect success mobile business service construct preliminary measurement tool measure level success give variability tool already available measure usability productivity review previous section much would anyone want develop yet another set tool us two main reason first current tool address specific context interest namely mobile service business use second current tool address either strongly feel need address order measure success order understand success factor mobile service use mobile work context conduct two case study first case study examine mobile business service use taxi book dispatch taxi use service constantly daily work drive service use example accept incoming request search address map message dispatch taxis service use fix device second case study study mobile business service use construction sit weekly safety safety delegate observe various safety issue construction site use mobile service document service use mobile phone goal gain understand phenomena measure success factor mobile business service use qualitative research gain understand therefore study base interpretive research paradigm whereby aim understand context system better see seven positivist paradigm assumption measurable phenomenon dependent single observer data collection use focus group interview data collection take place spring first case study conduct two focus group total nine taxi two pair interview analyze success factor mobile work context use taxi order book dispatch system evaluate service perspective new observe train almost fifty taxi driver three train sessions sessions use mobile service complete typical usage classroom set evaluate flow interaction usability issue taxi system two usability spend one hour use demonstration system complete typical taxi driver task accept customer order locate address map change interface gain wide business perspective theme relate success mobile business service interview taxi company manage director chairman board second case study one group discussion construction site discuss use service construction company service provider addition interview one user another construction site observe three two different construction sit use mobile service perform safety measurement better understand challenge new service bring along also observe traditional safety measurement process safety measurement do fill paper form ask fill questionnaire order get information usefulness questionnaire context data analysis focus group interview first case study interview record digital voice recorder transcribe analysis transcribe interview analyse qualitatively order find important theme relate mobile work content analysis interview analyse least two observe data advance interaction five collect take note analyse observe process deeply understand task perform work involve process forth analyse follow also compare result line data collection phase group discussion goal elicit common understand important theme five result section present dimension relate success mobile business service find case study section present initial version questionnaire measure success mobile business service success factor reveal case study case study find mobile business service need fulfill similar usability service need effective efficient pleasant easy use make easier mobile accept new service daily work company point view improve productivity see important success factor also line previous study see three four eleven case mobile business service help perform work productively moreover service mobile safety important aspect success taxi drive construction walk around construction sit use service case need observe environment interaction service avoid addition general usability productivity safety find important success service fourteen role usability evaluation addition well discuss importance mobile usability business use severe happen even learn use service learn take much time learn phase may expensive company deploy service work task do efficiently possible well service provider service provider cost due example numerous call extend need support use safety measurement service install mobile phase find play critical role success service succeed installation could easily switch back use traditional method perform work task construction company mean benefit service achieve installation phase critical taxi case taxi install service however note installation onetime activity increasingly successful installation likely affect possible installation process much important thing get service taxi case one factor large effect service level support whether felt receive enough support hear act upon support also important role construction case mobile safety measurement service need additional help move example one observation user know answer incoming call without distract safety measure end need start measurement result two system user support need combine two together moreover find mobile business service need take account issue relate mobile context previous study understand context also see essential success mobile service design eight forty addition state need go track physical attribute able understand effect context better analyse context work need understand one structure cue invite enter information space task entry point two mental physical space construct accomplish task action landscape three environmental structure help manage complexity task mechanism explore context work environmental context include surround environment physical also organizational factor set design mobile business service sometimes change context challenge manage example sunshine coldness use mobile service provide work space technology network taxi case study taxi need cope change environmental context find lose time time change location cold weather slow device sunshine make difficult read screen construction case lose connection also distract main task safety measurement process small key mobile phone difficult use especially wintertime addition new need compatible old development measurement tool order develop proper measurement tool mobile business service decide develop initial version questionnaire questionnaire research method six advance interaction relatively efficient cheap advantage usability questionnaire compare laboratory expert review questionnaire reasonable easy quick carry also real end product involve process measure make questionnaire use example make comparison user satisfaction different service compete service begin development questionnaire take exist questionnaire test second case study construction questionnaire simple quick fill unfortunately usefulness current context find limit take account mobility service business context example claim think would like use system frequently confuse must use mobile service perform work task also notice ambiguous find various function system well integrate case study several success factor identify effectiveness efficiency user satisfaction ease use safety ease installation support factor relate mobile context productivity effectiveness efficiency user satisfaction also iso standard definition usability

specifically focus issue relevant mobile work context thus revise question exist tool better measure success factor important mobile business service also add new dimension success namely safety mobile context productivity exist usability measure mainly develop consumer market use usability test contrast usability measure mobile business service must take account different use use service pose among mobile business service use different mobile phone fix usability measure need take account appropriateness device task addition exist tool take account fact service typically part story service may fail support work task part network need support use service mobile service rarely act independent tool work environment information need transfer somewhere thus important mobile service device enable fast easy connection address issue dimension mobile context include question relate actual physical context mobile device environment well overall system context see six context consumer service subjective satisfaction ease use extremely important factor large effect acceptability adoption service twenty addition consumer service often freedom like current service choose another one business context end often choice use system unfortunately often even say company decide service deploy despite rather feel subjective satisfaction important take account also business context likely effect measure overall work satisfaction productivity order evaluate productivity impact add direct indirect subjective productivity measure theme mobile work productivity addition especially question theme efficiency effectiveness closely relate productivity exist select base theme relevance business use select modify mobile service work task note theme question need adapt base context apply example service intend taxi use inside need ask service well dust walk addition theme relevant deployment phase continue use example ease installation crucial early stag usage whereas effect
