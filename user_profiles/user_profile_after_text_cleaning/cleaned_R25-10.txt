experiment comment visual feedback would benefit additional click consistent previous research sound confirm selection also support type rhythm better visual feedback alone three four combine speech visual feedback make sure focus selection distinguishable feedback see experiment feedback may confusion simple audible click help make moment selection distinct clear see second experiment use click

long dwell time animation provide extra information dwell time progress natural fixate long time static target animation help maintain focus target letter long dwell time second experiment shrink

show direct continuous fashion time remain selection use simple feedback short dwell time short dwell time require sharp clear feedback example speak feedback may problematic may clear user whether

short dwell time feedback focus selection distinguishable feedback distinct point selection uncertainty exact moment selection do general usability indicate feedback action provide within reasonable
