cluster classification use categorize web search result base solely short text return search engine however believe name problem associate cluster classification complexity could avoid different

result word appear commonly know simply select frequent word work article frequent word like carry much mean use stop word list exclude word category list second problem simple lexical word match simple word make different car would two different word order reduce problem use word stemmer snowball stemmer martin porter stemmer remove word end simple word map word stem previous build way enable
