closely associate role intend element play example sight infer list link menu due way render screen render information define within associate via tag attribute class id typically one style page refer provide single point annotation propagate every page reduce annotation overhead annotate document occur single location however content associate indirectly annotate provide accurate role element explicitly state additionally high achieve define allow every page within without requirement every page annotate current prototype proxy sit user web browser server allow create share add repository tool use conjunction style exist web evolve form series static web page dynamic rich application environment precise definition new web twenty emphasis interaction community openness actively contribute eight assistive screen accessibility current target traditional static web content information access linear fashion however web twenty include dynamically update within page break linear assumption nine one solution take browser ten identify present update content page approach benefit require modification page markup treat update equal may necessarily case furthermore provide access content change whereas live also contain application style therefore allow assistive communicate live currently develop aria one allow enhance accessibility rich content contain within define state interactive contain within page include user interface update content news explicitly state role purpose element assistive interact content provide access dynamic content aria require modify exist web content insert additional semantic require assistive interact web twenty therefore need ownership document full understand aria markup affect assistive technology example aria allow update give priority assistive technology inform user update occur announce update immediately overwhelm user nine aid web twenty develop framework two open source framework allow use high level pattern develop underlie aria markup framework provide code already contain necessary require insert aria web content merely define series use inform framework aria insert page framework ensure valid markup insert web page also allow aria insert page dynamically allow community enhance accessibility web twenty base page without need document ownership three combine previously discuss make use describe play within annotate extend use within cascade style sheet ignore user interpret however tool interpret additional value provide mechanism understand role element order apply suitable example declare element menu add definition original prototype use document object model dom page create format suit sequential audio output screen reader however web content manipulation inform tool role element play tool interpretation determine content manipulate therefore modify could use conjunction rather manipulate dom aria insert web page allow navigate interact static web content manner similar application use consistent set key press initial experiment four key command incorporate engine applicable first two key press n standard story menu one page summary two main information three indicate b story combine main information highlight blue reach user press n key figure one comparison standard news story page version story last visit navigate next important chunk information page p navigate previous important chunk information command analogous original transformation reorder whereby content rearrange important content place top page follow next important finally least important however rather understand become familiar layout content press two key move forward backwards main information contain within page third key press jump focus assistive technology main menu page command analogous original transformation menu place menu bottom page longer require understand modify layout press single key move focus directly menu allow easier navigation fourth key press provide summary page original notion summary generate specific chunk text within page provide overview case see section four alternatively meta name description content tag locate head element document use tag typically hide user inform user page without interact content key part framework generation code incorporate inform framework aria insert page key press aria map language use reach part document either point explicit nod one select first meta tag head element document identify specific class select unordered list class value class element annotate use method typical create generate file limit set key press match value annotation remainder file remain constant merely create suitable expression give annotation insert file specify key press process insert code web page use two stage process first stage require annotate file allow generate appropriate file base present within file time file also assign particular set address could explicit example inform page domain give file generate file alternatively wild card could use inform final domain name give file generate file associate pattern browse web usual albeit via proxy whenever access associate generate file code dynamically insert page allow access content use key press four example figure show news story indicate one two three show menu page summary main information respectively inspect cascade style sheet see style menu define use element name class style summary define use element name id style main content define use element name id annotate use suitable value example menu element would give value annotate file generate file use framework insert aria page assistive interact menu example statement id generate associate key press map perspective designer create behind designer concern element describe menu render annotate code call framework assign appropriate key press create figure demonstrate user interact page page look identical original page show figure exception title highlight blue lens user navigate web page appropriate file use page inject suitable aria press n key take focus assistive technology directly start main story page press n key would allow user skim story paragraph paragraph allow easy skim read user navigate page interest banner surround main story single key press allow directly access content page likely interest five conclusion future work framework method allow web twenty inject accessible rich content dynamically key element platform generation content navigation rule use inform framework aria insert page approach use semantic drive transformation process improve access web page visually impair use screen reader previously static page content format suit sequential audio output screen reader however describe role play within web page independent output produce modify process form basis generation use framework inject aria web content allow navigate interact static web content manner similar application use consistent set key press experimental prototype describe demonstrate technical feasibility use vehicle insert aria web content research still require four key press choose limit employ ing navigation menu define area main information reside future focus key press may benefit may necessarily appropriate every page example list current popular common many news furthermore technical prototype demonstrate ability enhance accessibility still remain unclear user study require establish key press add use framework benefit however remain outstanding work combine demonstrate flexibility annotation approach addition also
