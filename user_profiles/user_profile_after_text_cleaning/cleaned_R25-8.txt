technology bring along discuss next mobile taxi book service accord interview successful service taxi one provide information need fast without many action user taxi felt every single action make focus attention system instead traffic safety risk thus number action minimize basic message clear important keep interface simple mobile service provide feature make possible indicate shortly available new although feature would make automatic dispatch taxis efficient taxi use feature often due feel use feature cumbersome current implementation taxi need manually input location available improve feature phase example location taxi available automatically approximate base information current location direction car go well driver approximation available could use make accurate accord one biggest use service navigation four main part service contain one extra step security risk every extra selection mean focus device observe traffic disturb unfortunately seem simple reorganization service would alleviate problem interview different different view right order would like although alleviate problem complex simply reorder presentation information service would beneficial work taxi

functionality troublesome use work efficient possible get nearest wait customer may even lose drive empty taxi less profit per also affect wait time increase pick longer distance information taxi soon available near customer dispatch system currently available taxis take account search chain rule automatically thirdly good usability may increase quality information mobile service system support service mobile service use work accurate information positive effect success business whereas delay information decrease benefit could gain system example information input system incorrect due usability taxi go wrong address severe negative effect driver profit per usage time gasoline consumption customer satisfaction dissatisfaction dispatcher likely decrease work satisfaction communicate likely fourthly good usability support learn use new service achieve target level efficiency faster turn improve work performance decrease cost need deployment phase example use field unintended enter
