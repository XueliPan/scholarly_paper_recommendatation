result classification information storage retrieval information search retrieval search process selection process web search user study mouse usage eye track introduction relate work explore potential analyze click pattern web search five data extremely valuable especially represent behaviour task still example indicate result user consider decide click eye track provide much detail small scale study user physically present contrast mouse web page collect accurately easily remotely large scale use therefore set explore potential usefulness track mouse web search result page previous study

top every search result page visit capture user mouse regularly submit gather data capture eye use eye tracker run screen recruit fourteen male eighteen female age range wide range web search experience familiar exclude data seven calibration eye tracker task use set sixteen web search task close question specific correct answer although also include three task user make decision base preference provide initial query task ensure user would see page result first procedure begin task participant follow link fake home page initial query search box task description insert underneath instruct press search button read understand description query reach result page whatever think need order complete task read text result page click link change query result pattern visit search result page generate two follow user eye mouse see figure one two eye circle area proportional fixation duration mouse data point overlay result page data point plot time style visualization propose al seven data involve way clarify order user scan search result add mouse data make much easier us understand relative time ie user eye mouse time also expose interest phenomenon often continue scan result page click wait select page load two author manually inspect general usual start position mouse pointer correspond position search button previous page begin task force click button also common start point eye point number possible pattern may simply keep mouse relatively still decide action take example click particular result figure two refer mouse usage like incidental ie case move mouse usual purpose click somewhere page manipulate web browser active mouse usage hand user seem make use mouse pointer help task process search result decide one click find three distinct pattern active mouse usage follow eye horizontally user move mouse pointer horizontally across text currently read figure one follow eye vertically user move mouse pointer page remain either touch roughly level region user currently read illustrate figure four may way help user keep track current place page mark particular result pattern illustrate figure three user leave mouse pointer near result seem promise one read far eye continue check result often mouse pointer leave hover title promise result ready click user eventually decide select another result seem promise user move mouse result difference pattern previous one mouse seem use purpose mark interest result simply keep user current place page read note many involve incidental mouse usage user make quick decision click result near top page use mouse otherwise part many task specific particular target result usually top page seem mouse become actively use user move past first part page particularly interest analyze case active mouse usage choose look detail seven task particular target result task correct answer present many different page shop task user make selection appeal taste manually seven task task choose use first visit first search result page total seven task x figure one example mouse follow eye horizontally red dot show eye black line show path mouse user run mouse pointer part snippet contain answer task actress academy award best actress end task without click follow eye eighteen nine horizontally follow eye nineteen vertically mark result fourteen table one incidence active mouse seven task analyze visit may contain multiple type behaviour right column indicate number exhibit behaviour least one task active behaviour visit x one visit visit result active mouse show table one overall visit involve one active mouse usage pattern although follow eye horizontally behaviour generally quite rare nine exhibit least one task two exhibit task analyze one case user move mouse pointer answer question visible result page also instance seem user simply use mouse help read follow eye vertically behaviour common active exhibit least six three exhibit task three task visit seem use mouse keep track current place page mark particular result behaviour exhibit least half inspection base previous work selection four believe likely exhibit pattern find task difficult obvious result best especially move page study require confirm count report apply specifically seven task choose analyze particular target result analyze task study overall prevalence active would lower number exhibit active behaviour would higher yet clear evaluate representativeness set web search task difficult know prevalent would everyday web search work control experiment systematically manipulate search result result order accord relevance would help confirm find present find experiment would assist generate reliable valid metrics mouse data metrics would prerequisite conduct study mouse data collect deploy code web search site sample data would possible use machine learn attempt automatically identify pattern active mouse behaviour discover several different pattern eye mouse web search result page often move mouse click especially case highly relevant target result visible near top page however identify three seem indicate active usage mouse help user process content search result page follow eye vertically follow eye horizontally mark particular result work require enable reliable identification mouse data alone figure two incidental mouse usage user keep mouse mostly still move read result five decide click visualization leave eye red dot area proportional duration mouse path black line x click overlay original page right eye mouse plot time reveal relative figure three example use mouse mark promise result continue check eye case user leave mouse hover title result three read result four five move mouse result five result one two finally decide click result five
