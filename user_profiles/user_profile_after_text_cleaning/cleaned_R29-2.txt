provide personalize alert graduate base extensive description system carry present underlie ontology model available knowledge well higher level knowledge inference decision make achieve reason finally outline technical develop system cover integration various one introduction involve issue recent application continuously search ways offer personalize service higher level user base multitude need demand service exploit information many different user behavior location whether member work group personal like dislike information fall notion user context context allow information follow user usually case personalization crucial design personal notification alert service contribute satisfaction need productivity timely reliable instant update effective support need constantly part competent academic attempt address need offer personalize alert service graduate improvement graduate open multiple source information academic community university many case desirable demand information reach right interest party right time preset deadline identify three distinct type information interest party might want access personalize alert thus focus system develop inform cancel first category alert aim lecture change timetable room use lecture extra lecture relate alert allow keep current schedule attend course semester university alert constitute handle separate category information refer general alert category derive graduate secretariat library campus finally third source alert relate group academic community either share interest photography sail paint group work project participate work team exploit advantage semantic web order provide alert service describe ontology assist create knowledge model rich expressive well extensible moreover rule enable reason

user location task crime alert support collaborative two another campus information system support information post news schedule use short message service work combine mobile ambient display use proximity detection interaction mechanism order inform campus either show information directly display send message mobile three commercial emergency notification system empower dispatch time sensitive message emergency broadcast school close key feature offer centralize platform deliver notification entire audience mean include message apart university mobile exploit offer immediate notification service general hong institute education library four develop alert service enhance communication library achieve integrate mobile phone calendar provide simplify important library notice availability request overdue finally offer suite set intelligent notification service five base user intelligent notification service support follow type direct send popular delivery channel support include channel send short text message mobile approach unlike exception take advantage semantic web ontology reason provide personalize service boost performance employ cache unlike focus deliver live direct employ service three motivate scenario order illustrate need motivate development consider follow scenario graduate student decide attend course semester lecture schedule today however due unforeseen event prof cancel lecture need notify immediately cancellation reschedule lecture lecture attend reschedule appoint head project team set date first team meet day meet come need contact team inform meet location also want remind campus premise team meet visit library collect material relate team project also member campus photography group want exhibition worth check inform final date course semester approach secretariat need inform submit date secretariat decide inform every day final date student miss deadline case notification system use scenario highlight multiple source notification typical academic community notification address subset community urgent need repeatedly send finally also note give multitude alert one student receive depend degree involvement would preferable group less urgent together single notification four model knowledge campus purpose model represent knowledge inherent system create ontology schema present section owl six choice model language mainly due fact enable reason seven rule decision make process describe section although fully exploit expressivity owl since model demand model easily extend complex owl construct enable impose several type class schema case want add service demand expressive model feature ontology represent knowledge system consist six main class interrelate several class interconnect depict figure

destination course effect instance course link property instance student class denote course attend particular student separate link exist course property teach allow denote teacher course model alert since develop system system core class underlie ontology alert class class represent alert real world also system instance class represent single alert multiple possible level urgency alert three special ability group repeatability number alert group together send single message property use denote whether alert group default alert group however order avoid long delay send alert wait group together special property repeat keep track time alert put hold introduce furthermore alert flag urgent use property important inform immediately without wait alert group far repeatability concern alert send repeatedly act constant particular event deadline threshold maximum number time alert send set sender well period time alert active two different ways limit repeatable alert necessary since send large number alert costly also annoy model team model different type group may form campus base similar interest project team class use team consist person instance example person belong team relate course project activity group like sail photography group every team distinct topic model separate class call topic contain interest purpose team information describe finally category class use model various alert range many ontology schema category instance model type sender example alert send graduate secretary sail team one distinct sender type category class instance model end alert instance link category instance define sender moreover team course instance also link specific category since source alert link realize property student instance also link category instance property denote specific student interest receive alert belong five decision make intelligence context aware system depend large extent ability infer new knowledge context information system take advantage semantic order make policy base available context information model ontology describe previous section final decision draw reasoner rule engine base express set rule semantic web rule language propose prototype develop order express rule provide different present aim standard rule language semantic web adopt system inherit benefit use standard instead specific implementation rule limit programmer

alert another set define condition alert group send text message rule denote whether user privilege require send alert specific team alert drop automatically populate user profile interest purpose set rule define due space describe two important rule first rule describe condition new alert send user alert student true cat cat repeat zero receive receive certain alert user already activate notification service interest include category specific alert note rule support new alert whose current iteration field zero repeatable alert additional rule check user desire receive alert multiple time apply second rule handle repeatable alert decide whether alert resent expire alert repeat r r true author alert define number alert consider expire reach maximum number note rule could also apply alert maximum field set one performance indicate performance degradation price pay use rule previous work similar decision make use extremely expensive term time consumption ten therefore suitable however latter fundamental problem rather problem protege implementation due fact simplicity primary concern design decision make module system use ontology store user team alert profile er use instead ontology solely use support decision make process upon every decision request necessary data import ontology exploit decision make remove preserve ontology explicitness decision make process efficiency figure two move average duration decision make process moreover cache system integrate decision make module save computational power fig two latter achieve cache specific decision specific input implementation cache system apache cache system eleven use depend nature rule cache efficient set distinct input value rule finite cache yield high hit ratio sufficient number assume sufficient memory instance integrate cache decision regard expire alert describe yield significant performance figure two depict roll average duration last twenty uniformly random alert total number purpose experiment assume maximum iteration field uniformly distribute one ten current iteration field uniformly distribute zero note distinct input indicate low memory conclude important note contain time
