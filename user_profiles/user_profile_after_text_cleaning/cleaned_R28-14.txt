introduction commercial search usually recommend numerous result associate user query however scientific literature show average number visit page per session less two frequently page show top twenty result fourteen twenty thus relevant piece result set consist page compare size complete answer collection besides user search behavior could compare navigation behavior follow sense little effort web want achieve fast precise result base search improve precision result new generation high precision search design six five certainly query word short search time associate task difficult address problem follow point view search engine know search could improve associate process improve precision result search consider context information previous query previous click document research support millennium nucleus center web research chile scientific literature show several work focus problem despite fact little understand search affect search process interact search engine result main idea work illustrate interaction bidirectional feedback relation order understand search process complex phenomenon constitute multiple factor relative position page answer collection semantic query word time involve among eleven study present novel approach describe analyze web search process firstly present technique use work log data identify sessions also build relational table make structure query data describe multiple factor relate process analyze information non aggregate way consider query click rank time involve query session request analysis allow identify collection frequently consider make query identify top query term top query also show query space finally explore correlation query term space document term space click analysis allow identify effect rank user show number query per query session number selection per position show behavior data finally introduce three model engine consider first calculate predictive model number click expect session give number query formulate know second calculate model transition query session also calculate stationary prob proceed third web congress five chain finally calculate time distribution transition model consider time involve query formulation document selection result provide enough evidence apply query document recommendation twelve relate work web usage mine paper focus could predict user behavior pattern order

number per query session figure ten log plot number per position six query session model aggregate query session model one main purpose study describe user behavior pattern query session start consider non empty query sessions study thus query instance least one page select answer focus analysis consider two independent number query formulate number page select query session figure eight scatter plot intersection query term text term firstly show number per query session log plot figure nine data show fifty query sessions one click answer hand ten check five answer average number click query without include empty sessions data follow distribution b one important aspect study show effect rank user intuitively expect page show better rank place click page less score position effect base follow fact search engine show result order relevance query thus influence position document present rank bias phenomenon could observe figure ten see figure data follow distribution b data show discontinuity position number ten twenty data show discontinuity appear also position thirty forty general position multiple ten show ten result per page result thus fact discontinuity interface bias finally page select show first result page another interest variable involve process visit time per select page intuitively variable important time spend select page indicate preference data see visit time per page less two half hand page show higher visit time fact indicate page relevant query obviously information could use order improve rank besides important proportion page show visit time proceed third web congress five two three four query probably session many click general kind sessions associate exhaustive search pattern consequence less define information need begin

figure twelve show second model final state depict concentric circle time distribution query session model third model address problem determine time distribution state transition transition time follow distribution could determine use log data order measure time query log consider two transition time distribution query sessions query formulation follow document time distribution click follow query formulation transition click follow query data show need take higher time order formulate query intuitively query formulation time distribute around expect value higher time probability density follow exponential distribution calculate time distribution kind transition use two parameter density function let random variable model time involve query formulation first click second click third click second click third click second query third query table four expect value second involve query session model probability density function give f zero zero figure thirteen show value transition transition query click highly correlate search engine interface effect saw section five search engine interface produce bias search process cause relative position document rank intuitively guess time involve search process also correlate rank see data assumption true first click kind transition follow figure thirteen show b parameter value transition consider see value independent query order however transition second higher order click time distribution follow previous case intuitively consequence search time involve change expect value zero higher value well know expect value random variable give expect value transition give table four one one time involve query formulation higher precede state document low order important see time bias previous view time involve order unbias result must subtract expect value view document time expect value query however expect value close zero thus subtraction affect final result seven conclusion propose model describe user behavior query sessions use query log data model propose simple provide enough evidence apply web search result show web formulate short query select page important proportion refine initial query order retrieve
