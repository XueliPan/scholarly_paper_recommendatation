manage camera system serve different video request cooper cooper alto laboratory ave alto abstract paper present camera system call contrast traditional camera system provide video stream every user simultaneously serve different request flexibility allow conveniently participate seminar meet pace meanwhile system provide seamless blend manual control control mix easily make video capture effort video quality camera construct set near panoramic camera panoramic camera provide basic functionality serve different view request camera manage algorithm improve overall video quality may affect watch detail video resolution use different camera management compare experimental section one introduction give sharp drop camera price easy access people increasingly prefer watch video remotely various distance learn good remote video access video broadcast class meet people sometimes prefer view choice one select someone else physical traditional camera system allow multiple remote point camera different position time serve different view request straightforward approach capture event panoramic camera cover every possible view serve different view request electronic however panoramic
