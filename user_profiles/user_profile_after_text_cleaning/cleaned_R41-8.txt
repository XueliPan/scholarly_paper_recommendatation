external factor digital cash regulatory across globe dynamics bank service paper focus solely address usability availability ie payment system reject hard use summary novel payment system achieve ease use much possible availability cash improve accuracy speed security criteria payment also need satisfy number security criteria cash good security offer considerable room improvement discuss preserve transaction semantics integrity payment process must ensure semantics well define tamper particular resilient replay attack guarantee atomicity ie interrupt transaction cancel entire transaction usually transfer physical currency require physical interaction party involve provide strong assurance transaction semantics maintain anonymous without external monitor step possible identify make

communication channel easily tamper enforce physical security key requirement mobile payment solution secure monetary token paper defer prior work implementation secure monetary token nine provide

system remain constant across multiple addition secure monetary token achieve physical security extensively rely hardware support provide secure wireless communication fast secure authentication secure data storage note expect store consistent limit impose complementary twelve secure wireless communication mechanism promote ease use use wireless communication medium medium must highly secure usability ie people easily perform necessary action quickly correctly choose use communication wireless medium three primary advantage first short range order twelve inch make hard intercept clearly

couple secure monetary token satisfy tamperproof impossible replicate theft resilience success criteria table one detail payment protocol security discuss still partial solution payment protocol must still enforce transaction semantics sense term mandate authentication take place use protocol guarantee transaction atomicity ie correctly register party involve true incomplete authentication increase number user step potentially impact usability negatively however case security outweigh usability concern adapt exist atomicity already deploy payment ten electronic wallet eleven instead build one scratch payment protocol use protocol party must touch phone twice complete transaction first touch exchange identify information use certificate ensure party know transact also establish transient secure share key make transaction resilient replay attack tamper external party second touch transaction possible use protocol whole transaction complete one touch phone also open possibility could make someone intend party hence choose err side caution security usability case choose use protocol eleven implement monetary exchange alternative would brand onetime spend certificate three tolerant compromise secure storage element however brand protocol primarily design asymmetric involve payer would require considerable adapt protocol conversely protocol implement without change main extension atomicity requirement transfer fail balance must revert back original state transaction choose mechanism deploy protocol rather digital mechanism counter base mechanism provide constant level overhead contrast digital coin indivisible therefore may require additional overhead payer exact change main drawback dependence secure element mention secure element secure data storage readily available modern cellular phone make approach viable thus payment protocol payer wallet payee wallet first first touch agree amount transaction authenticate certificate payer secure element make sure amount transaction exceed wallet balance deduct money sign payment message phone touch second touch protocol payer wallet send payment message payee observer verify payment message add amount wallet balance message valid payee wallet return electronic receipt proof transaction transfer payment message digital receipt must atomic transfer fail balance must revert back original state transaction method ensure atomicity typically use financial message transfer protocol enhance security require reauthenticate multiple time key point protocol practice approach require authentication step fast assumption prove false alternative single authentication flexible lockout available fifteen revisit issue user study ask choose different type payment result show section reinforce decision use protocol authentication thus protocol couple atomicity discuss allow satisfy transaction semantics criteria satisfy audit criteria key part protocol discuss previously exchange identify information transact party establish session key identify information clearly reduce anonymity however party include bank certificate monitor know anything transaction thus satisfy anonymous success criteria much cash apart enhance security secondary benefit compromise anonymity use protocol allow us create automatic sign receipt transaction availability sign receipt make accountability conflict resolution much easier true anonymity easily modify use instead actual name however current implementation allow satisfy audit criteria list section two satisfy usability criteria implement
