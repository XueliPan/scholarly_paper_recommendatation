efficient web page identification entity resolution school school university university school university abstract entity resolution er problem arise many case represent task multiple different source require identify refer different object unique associate paper propose model use web page identification identify merge refer one object together use classical name problem case study examine model subset digital library record first stage work favorable result indicate propose approach highly effective subject information storage retrieval information search retrieval cluster general term entity resolution web page identification name one introduction entity resolution er problem widely discuss recently information explosion world wide web find information people determine information refer one entity extremely difficult attribute like person name unique web page usually contain rich information help us identify difficult gain one typical search search engine result search mix page entity search task propose approach determine page useful identify page noisy information first stage research use classical name problem case study propose model identify web page without go inside page extract information order improve performance rest paper give formal problem formulation describe model section two present experiment section three also conclude study ongoing work section four copyright hold north two web page identification model many case nowadays multiple difficult identify unique example common several author share name digital library least sixty different author call wang name unfortunately limit information provide difficult identify therefore focus gain information external world wide web identify assume list e entity list web page w associate collect search engine page useful identify entity mark two might refer object high overlap web page key point know web page useful exist approach need go read page content order identify page however produce high cost millions need identify page associate entry might contain size information addition also difficult locate information like address page different write style therefore propose model perform web page identification without go inside page name first stage research select classical name problem case study definition name digital refer task attribute proper author previous work two taxonomy base cluster framework give enhance function solve name issue information use relationship data extract attribute data however experiment work show necessary involve resource web page provide evidence identify author refer previous model description name problem describe assume list e author name suppose exist k actual author ak name x goal assign entry e e e real author ai give list page p associate entry e model propose select page p useful identify entry e p two p high overlap figure one propose model flow diagram two assign author ai accord observation two type web page return search engine search entry use author name plus publication title personal home page public page obviously interest former type web page sufficient two find personal page public page therefore propose model identify page personal page detail give next section propose model figure one show flow diagram propose model assume two need identify link associate page two belong author entry list return search engine process continue overlap two list otherwise two refer different author overlap page query web information company provide web site information like traffic rank web page web site information page well organize get traffic rank page easily also set traffic rank range threshold generate accord traffic rank top ten digital page query higher level traffic rank model take page public page otherwise page treat personal page however personal page host famous university even higher traffic public page calculate traffic host order solve issue construct taxonomy base exist education contain term like university use method two propose decision function f p k accord taxonomy p page number associate p find taxonomy k total number p f p threshold value page personal page figure two precision recall three experiment result experiment use previous work two compare web page identification model follow standard evaluation process use precision recall value evaluate model set threshold six p recision p c p recall p c p p c number pair cluster correctly p number pair cluster incorrectly f number pair cluster show figure two strong evidence personal page model show much higher precision recall value previous model mistake due share page among web page information capture four ongoing work paper present web page identification model entity resolution identify web page without go
