important factor money multiplier effect two even minimal security measure prevent threaten value money simple upgrade result marginal cost physical digital cash tightly constrain current estimate suggest us government spend approximately per bill produce though recent measure increase cost almost eight require physical bill impose negligible overhead current bill production would raise production cost bill twenty instance unlikely adopt minimal cost number fail currency past popularize dollar coin show people generally conservative come currency tend resist drastic change perceive add value hence gain wide acceptance instance forge dollar bill deposit bank institution release circulation result fake money system three physical digital cash design put burden time provide tangible benefit namely bill exchange process impose additional transaction cost monetary otherwise user verification cost remain negligible compare actual value give bill usability currency extremely universal product almost every single individual use cash thus change currency must maintain high usability particular universal use physical digital cash provide usage current physical cash offer extreme ruggedness enable exchange without digital single physical digital cash bill pass one owner another contrast digital cash use destroy security resistant type counterfeit physical digital cash fulfill follow security give electronic verification device must impossible least infeasible create bill differ one issue legitimate entity word create bill new serial number instead limit duplication exist bill universal verifiability require bill verifiable use commodity electronic verification device way easily start verify correctness bill instance one approach consider paper employ current smart phone verification since phone quickly become ubiquitous useless duplication give electronic verification device must impossible duplicate exist bill successfully cash bill single physical

bill contain n physical digital cash bill contain n preserve ruggedness physical cash propose embed digital signature bill use sixteen show figure one previously use cryptographic verification meter postage thirty allow fast optical scan therefore easily verifiable evaluation since require electronic bill encode signature robust extreme physical condition encode process also employ cod enhance robustness signature thus satisfy universal use property physical digital cash long private key keep secret assume secure signature scheme one bill encode signature readily read commodity smart phone show figure one b achieve universal verifiability general reader much simpler verification smart phone especially japan south already equip reader note would five need verify bill possession however ability negligible cost important asset manufacture technology add bill trivial current bill already contain serial number print individual bill technology use also print reason satisfy simple upgrade property finally physical digital cash bill contain information traditional bill signature use verify authenticity bill thus propose scheme satisfy anonymity however use alone enforce useless duplication property indeed duplicate bill would serial number n original valid bill n n would remain valid achieve useless duplication property must turn additional alternate protection alternative

approach may fully satisfy universal use requirement present approach satisfy universal verifiability requirement yet penetrate consumer market likewise embed computational device bill would significantly raise cost per bill one accord increase alter production technology may remedy drawback technique currently provide simple upgrade since data store chip include information owner bill technique achieve anonymity perfectly secure chip may make forgery duplication impossible thereby directly enforce desire useless duplication unfortunately trust security chip extremely strong

expose bill condition match information print bill combine scheme signature scheme sign value characterize physical structure bill ensure property evaluation approach merit provide enhance security without change way people would use bill three important open remain however regardless physical function use first manufacture cost bill hard assess certainly much higher current production cost second may break get dirty easily result genuine bill fail verification process third equipment need verify enhance bill likely high investment let alone individual physical function easily satisfy universal verifiability simple upgrade universal use however discuss later believe physical function may useful deploy conjunction centralize verification centralize verification verification discuss section attempt achieve useless duplication property neither provide completely satisfactory solution represent interest point design space design one simple way make duplication costly keep issue serial number issue central bank require bank verify whether give serial number already deposit thus ensure two bill serial number deposit time add cryptographic signature bill would prevent introduction illegitimate serial number detect duplication legitimate serial number without cryptographic signature technique directly apply unmodified physical cash offer since detect introduction illegitimate serial number bill deposit bank evaluation give centralize verification utilize unmodified physical cash clearly meet universal use impose additional production cost make simple upgrade print process though impose cost central bank must maintain serial number well member bank must constantly monitor report serial number enter leave control centralize verification minimally impact traditional anonymity seven physical cash since bill remain unchanged serial number data already available member bank without centralize verification serial number partially provide limit verifiability since bank perform verification procedure duplicate bill remain circulation undetected extend time fact one bill deposit even central bank know duplication occur verification ideally
