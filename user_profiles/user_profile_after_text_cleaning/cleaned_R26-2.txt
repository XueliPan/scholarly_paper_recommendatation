use introductory program course goal paper demonstrate adaptive explanatory visualization use expression evaluation context support expression evaluation relatively complicate topic rarely support visualization tool paper present show expression evaluation visualization make adaptive explain approach adaptive generation two object visualization visualization tool learn c language introductory program course use adaptive visualization textual portray process expression evaluation support c addition modulo although address pointer arithmetic system visualize explain explicit well several implicit may appear context progress make explicit track show model implicitly one read variable two implicit cast three logical value representation example logical value representation model fact c language zero treat false nonzero value treat true concept may appear context many equal logical student knowledge implicit trace show implicit difficult identify three student view user interface segmentation user interface figure one divide four progress navigation blackboard progress region contain list explicit learn along progress know allow monitor progress region appear even expression evaluation begin first allow student pick expression evaluate either select expression enter expression also change initial value appear expression expression b seven contain variable b finally student switch system exploration knowledge evaluation figure one user interface system exploration mode exploration mode student present order evaluation restrict precedence system offer exploration mode student start use learn new concept mode build corpus knowledge second mode knowledge evaluation mode design let check level knowledge first student indicate order evaluation believe correct show correct order compare answer next ask provide value current expression two serve different purpose exploration mode knowledge accumulate organize knowledge evaluation mode check separation also maintain student model level describe section navigation region let us student navigate expression evaluation do basis whether forward backward additionally possible quickly jump begin end evaluation region blackboard present explain detail section additionally region display original expression order evaluation value expression currently evaluate capable show evaluation every operation detail depend kind complexity operation visualization include five stag introduce stage may include several step many step animate help follow change system adapt speed progress student adaptation detail give section different color use group visual green use highlight current operation yellow use visualize value operation red use visualize read write variable value finally cyan use color carry information specific context one variable read animation fourth insert value expression change color yellow green three variable write evaluation assignment yield number example seven yield seven however apart visualize value see value describe side effect change variable value need visualize well do three step value seven operation show first step value visualization first value seven highlight red second animation show value become new value variable question variable receive value seven third value highlight red change back point value visualization resume yellow change value variable example operation add one current value variable value change new value read expression process visualize four step first operation highlight cyan second animation show operation change value variable question third another animation show new value variable read expression value also show cyan fourth insert value change color green four five post change value variable example operation subtract one value variable subtraction happen rest current expression end visualize six step first operation highlight cyan second animation note value variable question change later third another animation show current value variable read expression value also show cyan fourth insert value change color green fifth rest evaluation end variable question highlight cyan sixth animation show previously remember operation subtract one finally execute change value variable current operation contain value need read evaluation continue read variable visualize three step first name variable highlight red second animation show current value variable insert operation value also show red third value insert color change red green two value production evaluation many yield number number replace operation instance two zero yield zero therefore zero replace two zero expression process visualize four step first operation two zero highlight green second value zero show yellow third value replace operation domain difficult think would beneficial make student aware deal difficult identify follow logical value representation two integer double implicit cast three double integer implicit cast four four difficult one encounter system feature four visual flag four difficult flag highlight orange particular concept logical value representation flag highlight context operator remind student c language zero denote false nonzero value denote true please note flag use student monitor instance progress represent student knowledge level visual difficulty subject use context current operation concept additionally describe complexity level define domain expert use five type student activity input student model guarantee particular set easily understand confuse especially know material addition natural language description visual helpful way provide necessary clarification operation insert value equip textual accompany visualization step explanation may empty example two three operation visualize four step value visualization previous section highlight operation show value animate value highlight short introduction summation operator present next value show explanation give two three sum five explanation change next step value animate limit number change screen one otherwise may get confuse change attend especially important animation take place visually subtle change like change explanatory text may notice movement take place elsewhere screen simultaneously explanation last step two three operation summation operator consider easy enough require additional step visualization difficult modulo would additional text present empty explanation construct one fragment text fragment address different idea system decide fragment present depend upon student level knowledge adaptive behavior describe detail section quality important bad word increase student confusion instead help understand material better use develop group program education adaptation informational need change learner gain insight learn material example important begin gradually become less less relevant certain point start become irrelevant student master would benefit see overly detail might discourage student might stop use tool convince nothing could learn also might get frustrate force see already know keep track student progress adapt important feature educational tool concept describe term exploration knowledge kex evaluation knowledge type knowledge represent student progress two available system progress easier happen difficult student see order
