ABSTRACT
We pose the question: what if digital library objects could
self-arrange without intervention from repositories and min-
imal intervention from administrators? We present back-
ground information about networks, techniques on how net-
works can be created based on locally discovered informa-
tion, and how a small set of controlling policies can pro-
foundly aﬀect network conﬁguration. This poster reﬂects a
work in progress, providing information about the project’s
genesis, current status and future eﬀorts.

INTRODUCTION

Survival of and access to digital library (DL) objects is
dependent on their long term availability in a networked
infrastructure. Availability is composed the fundamental
networking infrastructure and links from one DL object to
another. Maintenance and operation of the infrastructure
relies on both hardware and “wetware” components. Estab-
lishing and maintaining links between DL objects is the topic
of interest of this poster.

We use the tenets of “Small-World” networks (cf.

[2]) to
design, simulate and investigate linkages between DL ob-
jects to support their preservation in the face of failures of
the underlying infrastructure, deliberate attacks on highly
connected network nodes and the automatic re-constitution
of the links when a failure is detected.

2. ANALYSIS AND STATUS

Our approach is to identify locally applicable controlling
policies that can be used by any DL object while construct-
ing the network. We have identiﬁed three major policies:
how to select an initial node when adding a new node; how
to select subsequent nodes after the initial node; and how to
connect to other nodes after connecting to a suitable exist-
ing network node. Varying the parameters of these policies

cause radical changes in the network’s emergent behavior
(cf. [1]). Each node’s behavior is controlled by the values of
these policies. The node acts strictly on information that it
has gathered about the network. No outside entity controls
or monitors the node or the graph.

We have written a simulation to determine the eﬀects of
diﬀerent policies values. Analysis is of order O(n2) complex-
ity; doubling the size of the graph quadruples the analysis
time. Figure 1 shows the eﬀect of changing the ﬁnal attach-
ment policy on networks with 20 new nodes. Minor changes
in policy values produce striking changes in networks that
have even more nodes. The table shows that network graph
statistics vary slowly as a function of graph size using the
same policies as the bottom half of the ﬁgure. Currently

we simulate the insertion of singleton DL objects into a net-
work. Our next reﬁnement will be to have the node create
additional copies of itself to support preservation.
